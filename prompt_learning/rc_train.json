        "context": "Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7. For a funny, fast-paced overview of fungi, watch this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants.  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.  The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land.  Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.  Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below.  During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.  Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents.",

        "context": "Both you and the speck of dust consist of atoms of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume.  Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead.  The more matter an object contains, generally the more it weighs. However, weight is not the same thing as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object. It is measured with a scale, like the kitchen- scale in Figure 3.2. The scale detects how forcefully objects in the pan are being pulled downward by the force of gravity. The SI unit for weight is the newton (N). The common English unit is the pound (lb). With Earths gravity, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N (2.2 lb). Problem Solving Problem: At Earths gravity, what is the weight in newtons of an object with a mass of 10 kg? Solution: At Earths gravity, 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N. Therefore, 10 kg has a weight of (10  9.8 N) = 98 N. You Try It! Problem: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force, so mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes, even while the mass of the object remains constant. Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, in Figure 3.3. An astronaut weighed less on the moon than he did on Earth because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An \"empty\" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an \"empty\" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l  w  h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used to measure volume. You can see how it works in Figure 3.4 and in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements.  Matter has many properties. Some are physical properties. Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance. For example, whether a given substance normally exists as a solid, liquid, or gas is a physical property. Consider water. It is a liquid at room temperature, but if it freezes and",

The penis is a cylinder-shaped organ. It contains the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of the body. The urethra also carries sperm out of the body. This drawing shows the organs of the male reproductive system. It shows the organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it in the text. The two testes (singular, testis) are egg-shaped organs. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone. The testes are found inside of the scrotum. The scrotum is a sac that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The testes, being in the scrotum outside the body, allow the temperature of the sperm to be maintained at a few degrees lower than body temperature. This is necessary for the stability of these reproductive cells. The epididymis is a tube that is about six meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum. It rests on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm grow larger and mature. The epididymis also stores sperm until they leave the body. Other parts of the male reproductive system include the vas deferens and the prostate gland. Both of these structures are pictured below ( Figure 1.1). The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. Semen is a \"milky\" liquid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body. In addition to sperm cells, semen contains sugars (fructose) which provide energy to the sperm cells, and enzymes and other substances which help the sperm survive.",

        "context": "All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through empty space. That speed, called the speed of light, is 300 million meters per second (3.0  108 m/s). Nothing else in the universe is known to travel this fast. If you could move that fast, you would be able to travel around Earth 7.5 times in just 1 second! The sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth, but it takes electromagnetic radiation only 8 minutes to reach Earth from the sun. Electromagnetic waves travel more slowly through a medium, and their speed may vary from one medium to another. For example, light travels more slowly through water than it does through air (see Figure 21.4). You can learn more about the speed of light at this URL: http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/29407-assignme  Although all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed, they may differ in their wavelength and frequency.  Wavelength and frequency are defined in the same way for electromagnetic waves as they are for mechanical waves. Both properties are illustrated in Figure 21.5. Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points of adjacent waves. Wavelengths of electromagnetic waves range from many kilometers to a tiny fraction of a millimeter. Frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Frequencies of electro- magnetic waves range from thousands to trillions of waves per second. Higher frequency waves have greater energy.  The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency. Because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa. This relationship is represented by the equation: Speed = Wavelength  Frequency The equation for wave speed can be rewritten as: Frequency = Speed Speed or Wavelength = Wavelength Frequency Therefore, if either wavelength or frequency is known, the missing value can be calculated. Consider an electromag- netic wave that has a wavelength of 3 meters. Its speed, like the speed of all electromagnetic waves, is 3.0  108 meters per second. Its frequency can be found by substituting these values into the frequency equation: Frequency = 3.0  108 m/s = 1.0  108 waves/s, or 1.0  108 hertz (Hz) 3.0 m You Try It!

        "context": "What do temperature, clouds, winds, and rain have in common? They are all part of weather. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere at a given time and place.  Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the Sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply: The Sun heats Earths surface more in some places than others. Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate. Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind. The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall.  The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors.  Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.  Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1.  People often say, its not the heat but the humidity. Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat cant evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold. The heat index is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity. You can see the heat index in Figure 16.2.  Youve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point. If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew. As you can see in Figure 16.1, the dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why?  Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are called fog.  Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The particles are specks of matter, such as dust or smoke. Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water.  Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 16.3 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds dont usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The prefix nimbo- means rain. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall. When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus.  Clouds can affect the temperature on Earths surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Suns rays. This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds prevent",

        "context": "Elements form compounds when they combine chemically. Their atoms join together to form molecules, crystals, or other structures. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. It occurs when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom. You can learn more about chemical bonds in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Look at the example of water in Figure 7.1. A water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms share their two electrons with the six valence electrons of one oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. This gives it a more stable arrangement of electrons that takes less energy to maintain.  Water (H2 O) is an example of a chemical compound. Water molecules always consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Like water, all other chemical compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesnt matter how much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same composition.  Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Youve already seen the chemical formula for water. Its H2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript.

Both water (H2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) consist of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If youve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Both carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How do their properties differ?  There are different types of compounds.

        "context": "A biochemical compound is any carbon-based compound found in living things. Like hydrocarbons, all biochemi- cal compounds contain hydrogen as well as carbon. However, biochemical compounds also contain other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. They consist of many, smaller monomer molecules. Biochemical polymers are referred to as macromolecules. The prefix macro means \"large,\" and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of organisms. They are also involved in life processes, such as making and using food for energy. Given their diversity of functions, its not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds. However, they can be grouped into just four main classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The classes are summarized in Table 9.3 and described in the rest of this lesson. Class Carbohydrates Elements carbon hydrogen oxygen Examples sugars starches cellulose Proteins carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur carbon hydrogen oxygen carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus enzymes hormones Lipids Nucleic acids Functions provide energy to cells store energy in plants makes up the cell walls of plants speed up biochemical re- actions regulate life processes fats oils store energy in animals store energy in plants DNA RNA stores genetic information in cells helps cells make proteins  Carbohydrates are biochemical compounds that include sugars, starches, and cellulose. They contain oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Organisms use carbohydrates mainly for energy.  Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugar have just a few carbon atoms. The simplest sugar is glucose (C6 H12 O6 ). Glucose is the sugar that the cells of living things use for energy. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms. You can see the structural formula of glucose and two other sugars in Figure 9.16. The other sugars in the figure are fructose and sucrose. Fructose is an isomer of glucose. It is found in fruits. It has the same atoms as glucose, but they are arranged differently. Sucrose is table sugar. It consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.  Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. They consist of hundreds of glucose monomers bonded together. Plants make starch to store extra sugars. Consumers get starch from plants. Common sources of starch in the human diet are pictured in Figure 9.17. Our digestive system breaks down starch to simple sugars, which our cells use for energy.  Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. However, the glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers (see Figure 9.18). Have you ever eaten raw celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain long, stringy fibers. The fibers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to trunks and stems. Cellulose also provides needed fiber in the human diet. We cant digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract.  Proteins are biochemical compounds that contain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids.  Amino acids are the \"building blocks\" of proteins. There are 20 different common amino acids. The structural formula of the simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in Figure 9.19. Other amino acids have a similar structure. The sequence of amino acids and the number of amino acid chains in a protein determine the proteins shape. The shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function. Shapes may be very complex.

        "context": "The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, and epididymis ( Figure 1.1). The figure also shows other parts of the male reproductive system. The penis is a cylinder-shaped organ. It contains the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine out of the body. The urethra also carries sperm out of the body. This drawing shows the organs of the male reproductive system. It shows the organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it in the text. The two testes (singular, testis) are egg-shaped organs. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone. The testes are found inside of the scrotum. The scrotum is a sac that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The testes, being in the scrotum outside the body, allow the temperature of the sperm to be maintained at a few degrees lower than body temperature. This is necessary for the stability of these reproductive cells. The epididymis is a tube that is about six meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum. It rests on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm grow larger and mature. The epididymis also stores sperm until they leave the body. Other parts of the male reproductive system include the vas deferens and the prostate gland. Both of these structures are pictured below ( Figure 1.1). The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. Semen is a \"milky\" liquid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body. In addition to sperm cells, semen contains sugars (fructose) which provide energy to the sperm cells, and enzymes and other substances which help the sperm survive.",

        "context": "All volcanoes share the same basic features. First, mantle rock melts. The molten rock collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands. The hot rock is less dense than the surrounding rock. The magma rises toward the surface through cracks in the crust. A volcanic eruption occurs when the magma reaches the surface. Lava can reach the surface gently or explosively.  Eruptions can be explosive or non-explosive. Only rarely do gentle and explosive eruptions happen in the same volcano.  An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be 10,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb (Figure 8.6). Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion. Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, fly up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide. Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction. Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is Crater Lake (Figure 8.18).  Some volcanic eruptions are non-explosive (Figure 8.7). This happens when there is little or no gas. The lava is thin, fluid and runny. It flows over the ground like a river. People generally have a lot of warning before a lava flow like this reaches them, so non-explosive eruptions are much less deadly. They may still be destructive to property, though. Even when we know that a lava flow is approaching, there are few ways of stopping it!  Great volcanic explosions and glowing red rivers of lava are fascinating. All igneous rock comes from magma or lava. Remember that magma is molten rock that is below Earths surface. Lava is molten rock at Earths surface.  Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava.  The way lava flows depends on what it is made of. Thick lava doesnt flow easily. It may block the vent of a volcano. If the lava traps a lot of gas, the pressure builds up. After the pressure becomes greater and greater, the volcano finally explodes. Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into the air. Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas bubbles were when the rock was still molten. Fluid lava flows down mountainsides. The rock that the flow becomes depends on which type of lava it is and where it cools. The three types of flows are aa, pahoehoe, and pillow lava. Aa Lava Aa lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas. Aa forms a thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough, rubbly pieces. The solidified surface is angular, jagged and sharp. Aa can",

        "context": "Imagine a huge bar magnet passing through Earths axis, as in the Figure 1.1. This is a good representation of Earth as a magnet. Like a bar magnet, Earth has north and south magnetic poles. A magnetic pole is the north or south end of a magnet, where the magnet exerts the most force.  Although the needle of a compass always points north, it doesnt point to Earths north geographic pole. Find the north geographic pole in the Figure 1.2. As you can see, it is located at 90 north latitude. Where does a compass Q: The north end of a compass needle points toward Earths north magnetic pole. The like poles of two magnets repel each other, and the opposite poles attract. So why doesnt the north end of a compass needle point to Earths south magnetic pole instead? A: The answer may surprise you. The compass needle actually does point to the south pole of magnet Earth. However, it is called the north magnetic pole because it is close to the north geographic pole. This naming convention was adopted a long time ago to avoid confusion.  Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic field. Earths magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. You can see a model of the magnetosphere in the Figure 1.3. It is a huge region that extends outward from Earth in all directions. Earth exerts magnetic force over the entire field, but the force is strongest at the poles, where lines of force converge.

        "context": "A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy from place to place. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. An example of a mechanical wave is pictured in Figure 19.1. A drop of water falls into a pond. This disturbs the water in the pond. What happens next? The disturbance travels outward from the drop in all directions. This is the wave. A source of energy is needed to start a mechanical wave. In this case, the energy comes from the falling drop of water.  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.  There are three types of mechanical waves. They differ in how they travel through a medium. The three types are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. All three types are described in detail below.  A transverse wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. An example of a transverse wave is a wave in a rope, like the one pictured in Figure 19.2. In this wave, energy is provided by a persons hand moving one end of the rope up and down. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the persons hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can see a brief video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:  . To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL:  (0:22). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A transverse wave can be characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. This is illustrated in Figure 19.3. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.  Another example of transverse waves occurs with earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called secondary, or S, waves. An S wave is illustrated in Figure 19.4.  A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates in the same direction that the wave travels. An example of a longitudinal wave is a wave in a spring, like the one in Figure 19.5. In this wave, the energy is provided by a persons hand pushing and pulling the spring. The coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the disturbance passes through them. The direction of the wave is down the length of the spring, or the same direction in which the coils move. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http  A longitudinal wave can be characterized by the compressions and rarefactions of the medium. This is illustrated in Figure 19.6. Compressions are the places where the coils are crowded together, and rarefactions are the places where the coils are spread apart.  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called primary, or P, waves. They are illustrated in Figure 19.7.  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. It combines a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. Ocean waves are surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean",

        "context": "What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved.  Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. Common changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and vaporization. These changes are shown in Figure 4.18. Each is described in detail below.  Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer. Thats because a thermometer measures temperature, and temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. You can learn more about energy, temperature, and changes of state at this URL: http://hogan.chem.lsu.edu/matter/chap26/animate3/an2  Think about how you would make ice cubes in a tray. First you would fill the tray with water from a tap. Then you would place the tray in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator. The freezer is very cold. What happens next?  The warmer water in the tray loses heat to the colder air in the freezer. The water cools until its particles no longer have enough energy to slide past each other. Instead, they remain in fixed positions, locked in place by the forces of attraction between them. The liquid water has changed to solid ice. Another example of liquid water changing to solid ice is pictured in Figure 4.19. The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is its freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0C (32F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower freezing points. For example, the freezing point of iron is 1535C. The freezing point of oxygen is -219C.  If you took ice cubes out of a freezer and left them in a warm room, the ice would absorb energy from the warmer air around it. The energy would allow the particles of frozen water to overcome some of the forces of attraction holding them together. They would be able to slip out of the fixed positions they held as ice. In this way, the solid ice would turn to liquid water. The process in which a solid changes to a liquid is called melting. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes to a liquid. For a given type of matter, the melting point is the same as the freezing point. What is the melting point of ice? What is the melting point of iron, pictured in Figure 4.20?  If you fill a pot with cool tap water and place the pot on a hot stovetop, the water heats up. Heat energy travels from the stovetop to the pot, and the water absorbs the energy from the pot. What happens to the water next?  If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C.  A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling. This process is called evaporation. It occurs when particles at the exposed surface of a liquid absorb just enough energy to pull away from the liquid and escape into the air. This happens faster at warmer temperatures. Look at the puddle in Figure 4.21.",

        "context": "While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets worked to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft. People can live on this craft for a long period of time.  Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit. Figure 23.22 shows the last of these, Salyut 7. These were all temporary stations. They were launched and later inhabited by a human crew. Three of the Salyut stations were used for secret military purposes. The others were used to study the problems of living in space. Cosmonauts aboard the stations performed a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports. One crew could dock a spacecraft to one end. A replacement crew could dock to the other end. The U.S. only launched one space station during this time. It was called Skylab. Skylab was launched in May 1973. Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects of staying in space for long period. Devices on board were and for studying the Sun. Skylab reentered Earths atmosphere in 1979, sooner than expected.  The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station (Figure 23.23). Mir was launched in several separate pieces. These pieces were put together in space. Mir holds the current record for the longest continued presence in space. There were people living on Mir continuously for almost 10 years! Mir was the first major space project in which the United States and Russia worked together. American space shuttles transported supplies and people to and from Mir. American astronauts lived on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the two nations to learn from each other. The U.S. learned about Russias experiences with long-duration space flights. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001. It fell into the Pacific Ocean.  The International Space Station, shown in Figure 23.24 is a joint project between the space agencies of many nations These include the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA), several European countries (ESA) and the Brazilian Space Agency. The International Space Station is a very large station. It has many different sections and is still being assembled. The station has had people on board since 2000. American space shuttles deliver most of the supplies and equipment to the station. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research. This is important because the station has a microgravity environment. Experiments are done in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology and medicine.  NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle. This vehicle had to be reusable. It had to able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The new vehicle was called a space shuttle, shown in Figure 23.25. There have been five space shuttles: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. A space shuttle has three main parts. You are probably most familiar with the orbiter. This part has wings like At the end of the mission, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. The outside heats up as it descends. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The orbiter is later hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane.  The space shuttle program has been very successful. Over 100 mission have been flown. Space shuttle missions have made many scientific discoveries. Crews have launched many satellites. There have been other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had two tragic disasters. The first came just 73 seconds after launch, on January 28, 1986. The space shuttle Challenger disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in Figure 23.27. On board were seven crew members. All of them died. One of them was Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space.",

        "context": "Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from the nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. When they do, they gain or lose protons. Then the atoms become different elements. (Be careful not to confuse this radiation with electromagnetic radiation, which has to do with the light given off by atoms as they absorb and then emit energy.)  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel. Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which glows after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light and X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate. The plate was similar to film thats used today to take X-rays. You can see an example of an X-ray in Figure 11.1. As Becquerel predicted, the uranium left an image on the photographic plate. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day. He wasnt expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without being exposed to sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day. Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays without getting energy from light. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel prize. To learn more about the importance of Becquerels research, go to this URL: http://nobelprize.org/no Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term \"radioactivity.\" The other scientist was the French chemist Marie Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium. She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries. You can learn more about Marie Curie at this URL: http://nobelprize.or  Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ from each other because they have different numbers of neutrons. Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14. All carbon atoms have 6 protons, and most have 6 neutrons. These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the mass number (6 protons + 6 neutrons). A tiny percentage of carbon atoms have 8 neutrons instead of the usual 6. These atoms are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 are unstable because they have too many neutrons. To be stable, a small nucleus like carbon, with just 6 protons, must have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons. In other words, it must have the same number of neutrons as protons. In a large nucleus, with many protons, the ratio must be 2:1 or even 3:1 protons to neutrons. In elements with more than 83 protons, all the isotopes are radioactive (see Figure 11.2). The force of repulsion among all those protons overcomes the strong force holding them together. This makes the nuclei unstable and radioactive. Elements with more than 92 protons have such unstable nuclei that these elements do not even exist in nature. They exist only if they are created in a lab.  A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is called background radiation. It comes from various sources. One source is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. Another source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is generally considered to be safe for living things. A source of radiation that may be more dangerous is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks underground. It can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may build up and become harmful to people who breathe it.

        "context": "Flatworms are invertebrates that belong to Phylum Platyhelminthes. There are more than 25,000 species in the flatworm phylum. Not all flatworms are as long as tapeworms. Some are only about a millimeter in length.  Flatworms have a flat body because they lack a fluid-filled body cavity. They also have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. However, flatworms represent several evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have the following adaptations: Flatworms have three embryonic cell layers. They have a mesoderm layer in addition to ectoderm and endoderm layers. The mesoderm layer allows flatworms to develop muscle tissues so they can move easily over solid surfaces. Flatworms have a concentration of nerve tissue in the head end. This was a major step in the evolution of a brain. It was also needed for bilateral symmetry. Flatworms have bilateral symmetry. This gives them a better sense of direction than radial symmetry would.

URL:  Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adults body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form. Then the life cycle repeats.  Some flatworms live in water or moist soil. They eat invertebrates and decaying animals. Other flatworms, such as tapeworms, are parasites that live inside vertebrate hosts. Usually, more than one type of host is needed to complete the parasites life cycle, as shown in Figure 12.12.  Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse phylum. It has more than 80,000 known species. Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters in length. You can see an example of a roundworm in Figure 12.13.  Roundworms have a round body because they have a partial fluid-filled body cavity (pseudocoelom). This is one way that roundworms differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to eat, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in their partial body cavity. The fluid pressure adds stiffness to the body. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles, allowing roundworms to move easily over surfaces.  Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the life cycle repeats.  Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic organisms. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in moist soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate hosts. Several roundworm species infect humans. Besides ascaris, they include hookworms. Hookworms are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hosts intestines. You can see the hooks in Figure 12.14. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Female adults lay large quantities of eggs. Eggs pass out of the host in feces. Eggs hatch into larvae in the feces or soil. Then the cycle repeats. You can learn more about parasitic roundworms in humans by watching this short video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:",

        "context": "A machine is any device that makes work easier by changing a force. When you use a machine, you apply force to the machine. This force is called the input force. The machine, in turn, applies force to an object. This force is called the output force. Recall that work equals force multiplied by distance: Work = Force  Distance The force you apply to a machine is applied over a given distance, called the input distance. The force applied by the machine to the object is also applied over a distance, called the output distance. The output distance may or may not be the same as the input distance. Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  Examples of machines that increase force are doorknobs and nutcrackers. Figure 16.8 explains how these machines work. In each case, the force applied by the user is less than the force applied by the machine, but the machine applies the force over a shorter distance.  Examples of machines that increase the distance over which force is applied are paddles and hammers. Figure 16.9 explains how these machines work. In each case, the machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, but it reduces the strength of the applied force.  Some machines change the direction of the force applied by the user. They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which it is applied. Two examples of machines that work in this way are claw hammers and the rope systems (pulleys) that raise or lower flags on flagpoles. Figure 16.10 explains how these machines work. In each case, the direction of the force applied by the user is reversed by the machine. How does this make it easier to do the job?  An exoskeleton suit may seem like science fiction, turning ordinary humans into super heroes. But wearable robots are moving forward into reality. And for paraplegics, the ability to stand and walk that these machines provide is a super power.

URL:  You read above that machines do not increase the work done on an object. In other words, you cant get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, machines always do less work on the object than the user does on the machine. Thats because all machines must use some of the work put into them to overcome friction. How much work? It depends on the efficiency of the machine. Efficiency is the percent of input work that becomes output work. It is a measure of how well a machine reduces friction.  Consider the ramp in Figure 16.11. Its easier to push the heavy piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up off the ground. However, pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp creates a lot of friction. Some of the force applied to moving the furniture must be used to overcome the friction. It would be more efficient to use a dolly on wheels to roll the furniture up the ramp. Thats because rolling friction is much less than sliding friction. As a result, the efficiency of the ramp would be greater with a dolly.  Efficiency can be calculated with the equation: Efficiency = Output work 100% Input work Consider a machine that puts out 6000 joules of work. To produce that much work from the machine requires the user to put in 8000 joules of work. To find the efficiency of the machine,",

        "context": "The sperm and egg dont look anything like a human baby ( Figure 1.1). After they come together, they will develop into a human being. How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells? Keep reading to find out. Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together. This is called fertilization. Sperm are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse. They swim through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure 1.1). If the sperm breaks through the eggs membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth. The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times. It forms a hollow ball of cells. After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side of the uterus. This is called implantation. It usually happens about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl.",

        "context": "What do temperature, clouds, winds, and rain have in common? They are all part of weather. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere at a given time and place.  Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the Sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply: The Sun heats Earths surface more in some places than others. Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate. Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind. The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall.  The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors.  Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.  Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1.  People often say, its not the heat but the humidity. Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat cant evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold. The heat index is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity. You can see the heat index in Figure 16.2.  Youve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point. If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew. As you can see in Figure 16.1, the dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why?  Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are called fog.  Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The particles are specks of matter, such as dust or smoke. Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water.  Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 16.3 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds dont usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The prefix nimbo- means rain. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall. When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus.  Clouds can affect the temperature on Earths surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Suns rays. This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds prevent",

        "context": "While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets worked to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft. People can live on this craft for a long period of time.  Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit. Figure 23.22 shows the last of these, Salyut 7. These were all temporary stations. They were launched and later inhabited by a human crew. Three of the Salyut stations were used for secret military purposes. The others were used to study the problems of living in space. Cosmonauts aboard the stations performed a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports. One crew could dock a spacecraft to one end. A replacement crew could dock to the other end. The U.S. only launched one space station during this time. It was called Skylab. Skylab was launched in May 1973. Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects of staying in space for long period. Devices on board were and for studying the Sun. Skylab reentered Earths atmosphere in 1979, sooner than expected.  The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station (Figure 23.23). Mir was launched in several separate pieces. These pieces were put together in space. Mir holds the current record for the longest continued presence in space. There were people living on Mir continuously for almost 10 years! Mir was the first major space project in which the United States and Russia worked together. American space shuttles transported supplies and people to and from Mir. American astronauts lived on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the two nations to learn from each other. The U.S. learned about Russias experiences with long-duration space flights. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001. It fell into the Pacific Ocean.  The International Space Station, shown in Figure 23.24 is a joint project between the space agencies of many nations These include the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA), several European countries (ESA) and the Brazilian Space Agency. The International Space Station is a very large station. It has many different sections and is still being assembled. The station has had people on board since 2000. American space shuttles deliver most of the supplies and equipment to the station. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research. This is important because the station has a microgravity environment. Experiments are done in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology and medicine.  NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle. This vehicle had to be reusable. It had to able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The new vehicle was called a space shuttle, shown in Figure 23.25. There have been five space shuttles: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. A space shuttle has three main parts. You are probably most familiar with the orbiter. This part has wings like At the end of the mission, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. The outside heats up as it descends. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The orbiter is later hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane.  The space shuttle program has been very successful. Over 100 mission have been flown. Space shuttle missions have made many scientific discoveries. Crews have launched many satellites. There have been other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had two tragic disasters. The first came just 73 seconds after launch, on January 28, 1986. The space shuttle Challenger disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in Figure 23.27. On board were seven crew members. All of them died. One of them was Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space.",

        "context": "Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat. How does cellular respiration happen inside of the cell? Cellular respiration is a three step process. Briefly: 1. In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in a process called glycolysis. 2. In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria. The mitochondria are the organelles known as the energy \"powerhouses\" of the cells (Figure 1.1). In the mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle. Notice that mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae. These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place. 3. In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an electron transport chain. During this step, this energy is used to produce ATP. Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose. The later steps release much more ATP. Most of the reactions of cellular respira- tion are carried out in the mitochondria.  What goes into the cell? Oxygen and glucose are both reactants of cellular respiration. Oxygen enters the body when an organism breathes. Glucose enters the body when an organism eats.  What does the cell produce? The products of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is transported from your mitochondria out of your cell, to your red blood cells, and back to your lungs to be exhaled. ATP is generated in the process. When one molecule of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of 36 or 38 molecules of ATP. This only occurs in the presence of oxygen.  The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration is one molecule of glucose (C6 H12 O6 ) and six molecules of oxygen (O2 ) yields six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and six molecules of water (H2 O). Using chemical symbols the equation is represented as follows: C6 H12 O6 + 6O2  6CO2 + 6H2 O ATP is generated during the process. Though this equation may not seem that complicated, cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions divided into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.  Stage one of cellular respiration is glycolysis. Glycolysis is the splitting, or lysis of glucose. Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, and it occurs in the presence or absence of oxygen. During glycolysis a small amount of NADH is made as are four ATP. Two ATP are used during this process, leaving a net gain of two ATP from glycolysis. The NADH temporarily holds energy, which will be used in stage three.  In the presence of oxygen, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to proceed into the Krebs cycle. The second stage of cellular respiration is the transfer of the energy in pyruvate, which is the energy initially in glucose, into two energy carriers, NADH and FADH2 . A small amount of ATP is also made during this process. This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Hans Krebs. The Krebs cycle uses a 2-carbon molecule (acetyl-CoA) derived from pyruvate and produces carbon dioxide.  Stage three of cellular respiration is the use of NADH and FADH2 to generate ATP. This occurs in two parts. First, the NADH and FADH2 enter an electron transport chain, where their energy is used to pump, by active transport, protons (H+ ) into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. This establishes a proton gradient across the inner membrane. These protons then flow down their concentration gradient, moving back into the matrix by facilitated diffusion. During this process, ATP is made by adding inorganic phosphate to ADP. Most of the ATP produced during cellular respiration is made during this stage. For each glucose that starts cellular respiration, in the presence of oxygen (aerobic conditions), 36-38 ATP are generated. Without oxygen, under",

        "context": "Einsteins equation is possibly the best-known equation of all time. Theres reason for that. The equation is incredibly important. It changed how scientists view energy and matter, which are two of the most basic concepts in all of science. The equation shows that energy and matter are two forms of the same thing. This new idea turned science upside down when Einstein introduced it in the early 1900s. Amazingly, the idea has withstood the test of time as more and more evidence has been gathered to support it. You can listen to an explanation of Einsteins equation at URL: https://youtu.be/hW7DW9NIO9M Q: What do the letters in Einsteins equation stand for? A: E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and c stands for the speed of light. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so c2 is a very big number. Therefore, the amount of energy in even a small mass of matter is tremendous. Suppose, for example, that you have 1 gram of matter. Thats about the mass of a paperclip. Multiplying this mass by c2 would yield enough energy to power 3,600 homes for a year!  Einsteins equation helps scientists understand what happens in nuclear reactions and why they produce so much energy. When the nucleus of a radioisotope undergoes fission or fusion in a nuclear reaction, it loses a tiny amount of mass. What happens to the lost mass? It isnt really lost at all. It is converted to energy. How much energy? E = mc2 . The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy. Q: In a nuclear reaction, mass decreases and energy increases. What about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy? Are mass and energy not conserved in nuclear reactions? Do we need to throw out these laws when it comes to nuclear reactions? A: No, the laws still apply. However, its more correct to say that the sum of mass and energy is always conserved in a nuclear reaction. Mass changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy combined remains the same.",

The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume.  Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead.  The more matter an object contains, generally the more it weighs. However, weight is not the same thing as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object. It is measured with a scale, like the kitchen- scale in Figure 3.2. The scale detects how forcefully objects in the pan are being pulled downward by the force of gravity. The SI unit for weight is the newton (N). The common English unit is the pound (lb). With Earths gravity, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N (2.2 lb). Problem Solving Problem: At Earths gravity, what is the weight in newtons of an object with a mass of 10 kg? Solution: At Earths gravity, 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N. Therefore, 10 kg has a weight of (10  9.8 N) = 98 N. You Try It! Problem: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force, so mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes, even while the mass of the object remains constant. Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, in Figure 3.3. An astronaut weighed less on the moon than he did on Earth because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An \"empty\" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an \"empty\" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l  w  h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used to measure volume. You can see how it works in Figure 3.4 and in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements.  Matter has many properties. Some are physical properties. Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance. For example, whether a given substance normally exists as a solid, liquid, or gas is a physical property. Consider water. It is a liquid at room temperature, but if it freezes and",

        "context": "Love Canal gained worldwide attention in the late 1970s when the press started covering its story. The story is outlined below and illustrated in Figure 19.9.  The Love Canal disaster actually began back in the mid 1900s. The disaster continues even today. Starting in the early 1940s, a big chemical company put thousands of barrels of chemical waste into an old canal. Over the next 10 years, the company dumped almost 22,000 tons of chemicals into the ground! In the early 1950s, the company covered over the barrels in the canal with soil. Then they sold the land to the city for just a dollar. The city needed the land in order to build an elementary school. The company warned the city that toxic waste was buried there. But they thought the waste was safe. The school and hundreds of homes were also built over the old canal. As it turned out, the cheap price was no bargain. Chemicals started leaking from the barrels. Chemicals seeped into basements. Chemicals bubbled up to the surface of the ground. In some places, plants wouldnt even grow on the soil. People noticed bad smells. Many got sick, especially the children. Residents wanted to know if the old chemicals were the cause. But they had a hard time getting officials to listen. So they demonstrated and demanded answers. Finally, the soil was tested and was found to be contaminated with harmful chemicals. For example, it contained a lot of lead and mercury. Both can cause permanent damage to the human nervous system. The school was closed. More than 200 homes were evacuated. Much of the Love Canal neighborhood was bulldozed away. The area had a massive clean-up effort. The cleanup cost millions of dollars. More than three decades later, much of Love Canal is still too contaminated to be safe for people.  Love Canal opened peoples eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized there must be other Love Canals all over the country. Thousands of contaminated sites were found. The Superfund Act was passed in 1980. The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites, like the Elizabeth Copper Mine in Vermont (see the far-right image in Figure 19.9). The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the future.  Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is any waste that is dangerous to the health of people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic, corrosive, flammable, or explosive. Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth defects in people. It may also harm other living things. Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive waste may cause burns or destroy other materials that it touches. Flammable waste can burn easily. It may also give off harmful fumes when it burns. Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be greater if the waste is mixed with other substances. Table 19.1 shows some examples of hazardous waste. Look closely. Are any of these examples lurking around your home? Example Description Cars contain toxic fluids such as brake fluid. The fluids may also be corrosive and flammable. This photo shows one way the fluids can end up in the ground. Cars use gas and oil. These materials are toxic and flammable. They pollute the land when they leak or spill. Batteries contain toxic and corrosive materials. People often toss them in the trash, but they should be disposed of properly. Electronics, such as old computers, contain toxic chem- icals. They may be sent to landfills where the toxic materials end up in the ground. Medical waste can contain many hazards: Human body fluids may cause disease; old thermometers may contain toxic mercury; and pharmaceuticals may be toxic to people and other living things. Example Description Paints can be both toxic and flammable. Paints may spill on the ground or be thrown improperly in the trash. Chemicals are applied to farm fields and lawns. They include fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of these chemicals are toxic to people and other animals.  The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry. Agriculture is another major",

        "context": "The central nervous system (CNS) ( Figure 1.1) is the largest part of the nervous system. It includes the brain and the spinal cord. The bony skull protects the brain. The spinal cord is protected within the bones of the spine, which are called vertebrae.  What weighs about three pounds and contains up to 100 billion cells? The answer is the human brain. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. Its like the pilot of a plane. It tells other parts of the nervous system what to do. The brain is also the most complex organ in the body. Each of its 100 billion neurons has synapses connecting it with thousands of other neurons. All those neurons use a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body. The developing brain of a baby uses an even greater amount of the bodys total energy. The brain is the organ that lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways. It also allows us to use language, learn, think, and remember. The brain controls the organs in our body and our movements as well. The brain consists of three main parts, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem ( Figure 1.2). 1. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It sits on top of the brain stem. The cerebrum controls functions that we are aware of, such as problem-solving and speech. It also controls voluntary movements, like waving to a friend. Whether you are doing your homework or jumping hurdles, you are using your cerebrum. 2. The cerebellum is the next largest part of the brain. It lies under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem. The cerebellum controls body position, coordination, and balance. Whether you are riding a bicycle or writing with a pen, you are using your cerebellum. 3. The brain stem is the smallest of the three main parts of the brain. It lies directly under the cerebrum. The brain stem controls basic body functions, such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. The brain stem also carries information back and forth between the cerebrum and spinal cord. The cerebrum is divided into a right and left half ( Figure 1.2). Each half of the cerebrum is called a hemisphere. The two hemispheres are connected by a thick bundle of axons called the corpus callosum. It lies deep inside the brain and carries messages back and forth between the two hemispheres. Did you know that the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body? By connecting the two hemispheres, the corpus callosum allows this to happen. Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four parts, called lobes. The four lobes are the: 1. 2. 3. 4. Frontal. Parietal. Temporal. Occipital. Each lobe has different jobs. Some of the functions are listed below ( Table 1.1). Side view of the brain (right). Can you find the locations of the three major parts of the brain? Top view of the brain (left). Lobe Frontal Parietal Temporal Occipital Main Function(s) Speech, thinking, touch Speech, taste, reading Hearing, smell Sight  The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons, protected by the vertebrae. It runs from the brain stem to the lower back. The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way highway. Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body what to do.",

        "context": "Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Air quality, in turn, depends on many factors. Some natural processes add pollutants to the air. For example, forest fires and volcanoes add carbon dioxide and soot. In dry areas, the air often contains dust. However, human actions cause the most air pollution. The single biggest cause is fossil fuel burning.  Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. The machines in factories burned coal. This released a lot of pollutants into the air. After 1900, motor vehicles became common. Cars and trucks burn gasoline, which adds greatly to air pollution.  By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad. The worst incident came in December 1952. A temperature inversion over London, England, kept cold air and pollutants near the ground. The air became so polluted that thousands of people died in just a few days. This event was called the Big Smoke.  At the same time, many U.S. cities had air pollution problems. Some of the worst were in California. Cars were becoming more popular. Oil refineries and power plants also polluted the air. Mountain ranges trapped polluted air over cities. The California sunshine caused chemical reactions among the pollutants. These reactions produced many more harmful compounds.  By 1970, it was clear that something needed to be done to protect air quality. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be released into the air. As a result, the air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles, factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.  There are two basic types of pollutants in air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.  Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by human activities. They pour into the air from vehicles and smokestacks. Several of these pollutants are described below. Carbon oxides include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn. Nitrogen oxides include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ). Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants. Sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO3 ). Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal burns. Coal can contain up to 10 percent sulfur. Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury is used in some industrial processes. It is also found in fluorescent light bulbs. Lead was once widely used in gasoline, paint, and pipes. It is still found in some products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds such as methane. VOCs are released in many human activities, such as raising livestock. Livestock wastes produce a lot of methane. Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil fuels burn (see Figure 22.1).  Secondary pollutants form when primary pollutants undergo chemical reactions after they are released. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants react together in the presence of sunlight. You can see smog hanging in the air over San Francisco in Figure 22.2. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3 ). The ozone in smog is the same compound as the ozone in the ozone layer,(O3 ). But ozone in smog is found near the ground. Figure 22.3 shows how it forms. When nitrogen oxides and VOCs are heated by the Sun, they lose oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms combine with molecules of oxygen to form ozone. Smog ozone is harmful to humans and other living things.  Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released when forests burn.",

The substance that dissolves in a solution is called the solute, and the substance that does the dissolving is called the solvent. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is called a concentrated solution. A solution with little dissolved solute has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution.  The concentration of a solution represents the percentage of the solution that is the solute. You can calculate the concentration of a solution using this formula: Concentration = Mass (or volume) of Solute Mass (or volume) of Solution 100% For example, if a 100-gram solution of salt water contains 3 grams of salt, then its concentration is: Concentration = 3g 100g 100% = 3% Q: A 1000 mL container of brand A juice drink contains 250 mL of juice and 750 mL of water.

        "context": "The Sun is Earths main source of energy. The Sun gives us both light and heat. The Sun changes hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion. This releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to the Earth mostly as visible light. The energy is carried through the empty space by radiation. We can use sunlight as an energy resource, called solar energy (Figure 5.7).  Solar energy has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Today we are using solar energy for more of our power demands. Solar power plants are being built in many locations around the world. In the United States, the southwestern deserts are well suited for solar plants.  Sunlight is turned into electricity at a solar power plant. These power plants use a large group of mirrors to focus sunlight on one place. This place is called a receiver (Figure 5.8). At the receiver, a liquid such as oil or water is heated to a high temperature. The liquid transfers its heat by conduction. In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are in contact. The higher temperature object transfers heat to the lower temperature object. For example, when you heat a pot of water on a stove top, energy moves from the pot to its metal handle by conduction. At a solar power plant, the energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.  Solar energy is used to heat homes and water, and to make electricity. Scientists and engineers have many ways to get energy from the Sun (Figure 5.9). One is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that turn sunlight directly into electricity. Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel. You may have seen solar panels on roof tops. The Suns heat can also be trapped in your home by using south facing windows and good insulation.  Solar energy has many benefits. It does not produce any pollution. There is plenty of it available, much more than we could possibly use. But solar energy has problems. The Sun doesnt shine at night. A special battery is needed to store extra energy during the day for use at night. The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until solar technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources.  Moving water has energy (Figure 5.10). That energy is used to make electricity. Hydroelectric power harnesses the energy of water moving down a stream. Hydropower is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world. This abundant energy source provides almost one fifth of the worlds electricity. The energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power. At this time, wave and tidal power are rare.  To harness water power, a stream must be dammed. Narrow valleys are the best for dams. While sitting in the reservoir behind the dam, the water has potential energy. Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large turbine. While flowing downhill, the water has kinetic energy. Kinetic energy makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity.  Many of the suitable streams in the United States have been developed for hydroelectric power. Many streams worldwide also have hydroelectric plants. Hydropower is a major source of Californias electricity. It accounts for about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of Californias nearly 400 hydroelectric power plants are located in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Water power does not burn a fuel. So it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy. Water power is also a renewable resource. Water keeps flowing downhill. Although we use some of the energy from this movement, we are not using up the water. Water power does have problems. A large dam stops a streams flow, which floods the land upstream. A beautiful location may be lost. People may be displaced. The dams and turbines also change the downstream environment. Fish and other living things may not be able to survive. Dams slow the release of silt. Downstream deltas retreat and beaches may be starved of sand. Seaside cities may become exposed to storms and",

Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 13 different vitamins. Some of them are listed below ( Table 1.1). The table also shows how much of each vitamin you need every day. Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps maintain good vision. Vitamin B9 helps form red blood cells. Vitamin K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound.

For example, vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Vitamins B12 and K are produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other vitamins must come from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( Table 1.1). Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too little vitamin C causes a disease called scurvy. People with scurvy have bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms.  Minerals are chemical elements that are needed for body processes. Minerals that you need in relatively large amounts are listed below ( Table 1.2). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and zinc. Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are needed for strong bones and teeth. Potassium and sodium are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally.

Instead, you must get minerals from the foods you eat. Good sources of minerals include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( Table 1.2). Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too little calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which bones become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium causes high blood pressure in some people.",

        "context": "While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets worked to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft. People can live on this craft for a long period of time.  Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit. Figure 23.22 shows the last of these, Salyut 7. These were all temporary stations. They were launched and later inhabited by a human crew. Three of the Salyut stations were used for secret military purposes. The others were used to study the problems of living in space. Cosmonauts aboard the stations performed a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports. One crew could dock a spacecraft to one end. A replacement crew could dock to the other end. The U.S. only launched one space station during this time. It was called Skylab. Skylab was launched in May 1973. Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects of staying in space for long period. Devices on board were and for studying the Sun. Skylab reentered Earths atmosphere in 1979, sooner than expected.  The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station (Figure 23.23). Mir was launched in several separate pieces. These pieces were put together in space. Mir holds the current record for the longest continued presence in space. There were people living on Mir continuously for almost 10 years! Mir was the first major space project in which the United States and Russia worked together. American space shuttles transported supplies and people to and from Mir. American astronauts lived on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the two nations to learn from each other. The U.S. learned about Russias experiences with long-duration space flights. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001. It fell into the Pacific Ocean.  The International Space Station, shown in Figure 23.24 is a joint project between the space agencies of many nations These include the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA), several European countries (ESA) and the Brazilian Space Agency. The International Space Station is a very large station. It has many different sections and is still being assembled. The station has had people on board since 2000. American space shuttles deliver most of the supplies and equipment to the station. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research. This is important because the station has a microgravity environment. Experiments are done in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology and medicine.  NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle. This vehicle had to be reusable. It had to able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The new vehicle was called a space shuttle, shown in Figure 23.25. There have been five space shuttles: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. A space shuttle has three main parts. You are probably most familiar with the orbiter. This part has wings like At the end of the mission, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. The outside heats up as it descends. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The orbiter is later hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane.  The space shuttle program has been very successful. Over 100 mission have been flown. Space shuttle missions have made many scientific discoveries. Crews have launched many satellites. There have been other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had two tragic disasters. The first came just 73 seconds after launch, on January 28, 1986. The space shuttle Challenger disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in Figure 23.27. On board were seven crew members. All of them died. One of them was Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space.",

        "context": "Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.  About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory.  In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense. It began to cool. First protons, neutrons, and electrons formed. From these particles came hydrogen. Nuclear fusion created helium atoms. Some parts of the universe had matter that was densely packed. Enormous clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually this material became the gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today.  We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.  We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up",

        "context": "We now know how variation in traits is inherited. Variation in traits is controlled by different alleles for genes. Alleles, in turn, are passed to gametes and then to offspring. Evolution occurs because of changes in alleles over time. How long a time? That depends on the time scale of evolution you consider. Evolution that occurs over a short period of time is known as microevolution. It might take place in just a couple of generations. This scale of evolution occurs at the level of the population. The Grants observed evolution at this scale in populations of Darwins finches. Beak size in finch populations changed in just two years because of a serious drought. Evolution that occurs over a long period of time is called macroevolution. It might take place over millions of years. This scale of evolution occurs above the level of the species. Fossils provide evidence for evolution at this scale. The evolution of the horse family, shown in Figure 7.13, is an example of macroevolution.  Individuals dont evolve. Their alleles dont change over time. The unit of microevolution is the population.  A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. All the genes in all the members of a population make up the populations gene pool. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles in the population. The gene pool can be described by its allele frequencies for specific genes. The frequency of an allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles for the gene in the gene pool. A simple example will help you understand these concepts. The data in Table 7.2 represent a population of 100 individuals. For each gene, the gene pool has a total of 200 alleles (2 per individual x 100 individuals). The gene in question exists as two different alleles, A and a. The number of A alleles in the gene pool is 140. Of these, 100 are in the 50 AA homozygotes. Another 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. The number of a alleles in the gene pool is 60. Of these, 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. Another 20 are in the 10 aa homozygotes. The frequency of the A allele is 140/200 = 0.7. The frequency of the a allele is 60/200 = 0.3. Genotype AA Aa aa Totals Number of Individuals 50 40 10 100 Number of A Alleles 100 (50 x 2) 40 (40 x 1) 0 (10 x 0) 140 Number of a Alleles 0 (50 x 0) 40 (40 x 1) 20 (10 x 2) 60 Evolution occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. For example, the frequency of the A allele might change from 0.7 to 0.8. If that happens, evolution has occurred. What causes allele frequencies to change? The answer is forces of evolution.  There are four major forces of evolution that cause allele frequencies to change. They are mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool This is how all new alleles first arise. Its the ultimate source of new genetic variation, so it is essential for evolution. However, for any given gene, the chance of a mutation occurring is very small. Therefore, mutation alone does not have much effect on allele frequencies. Gene flow is the movement of genes into or out of a gene pool It occurs when individuals migrate into or out of the population. How much gene flow changes allele frequencies depends on how many migrants there are and their genotypes. Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies. It occurs in small populations. Allele frequencies in the offspring may differ by chance from those in the parents. This is like tossing a coin just a few times. You may, by chance, get more or less than the expected 50 percent heads or tails. In the same way, you may get more or less than the expected allele frequencies in the small number of individuals in the next generation. The smaller the population is, the more allele frequencies may drift. Natural selection is a change in",

        "context": "The senses of taste and smell are more complicated than many people might think and have a surprisingly large impact on behavior, perception and overall health. Imagine your sense of smell disappearing as you age. Though this doesnt usually happen, it could provide clues about diseases of the nervous system. What about differences in taste? Do all foods taste the same to all people? Are there some foods you would never eat because you dont like the taste? Does this food taste good to other people? Genetic differences in taste could help predict what we eat, how well our metabolism works, and even whether or not were overweight. These two senses actually work together to provide some of the basic sensations of everyday life.  Your sense of taste is controlled by sensory neurons, or nerve cells, on your tongue that sense the chemicals in food. The neurons are grouped in bundles within taste buds. Each taste bud actually has a pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. There are five different types of taste neurons on the tongue. Each type detects a different taste. The tastes are: 1. Sweet, which is produced by the presence of sugars, such as the common table sugar sucrose, and a few other substances. 2. Salty, which is produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions. Common salt is sodium chloride, NaCl. The use of salt can donate the sodium ion producing this taste. 3. Sour, which is the taste that detects acidity. The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, and sometimes melon. Children show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy such as Lemon Drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst, is popular. Many of these candies contain citric acid. 4. Bitter is an unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable taste. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, beer (due to hops), olives, and citrus peel. 5. Umami, which is a meaty or savory taste. This taste can be found in fish, shellfish, cured meats, mushrooms, cheese, tomatoes, grains, and beans. A single taste bud contains 50100 taste cells representing all 5 taste sensations. A stimulated taste receptor cell triggers action potentials in a nearby sensory neuron, which send messages to the brain about the taste. The brain then decides what tastes you are sensing.  Your sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals. The neurons are found in the nose, and they detect chemicals in the air. Unlike taste neurons, which can detect only five different tastes, the sensory neurons in the nose can detect thousands of different odors. Have you ever noticed that you lose your sense of taste when your nose is stuffed up? Thats because your sense of smell greatly affects your ability to taste food. As you eat, molecules of food chemicals enter your nose (actually your nasal cavity). You experience the taste and smell at the same time. Being able to smell as well as taste food greatly increases the number of different flavors you are able to sense. For example, you can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food is sweet, but you have to also use your sense of smell to learn that the food tastes like strawberry cheesecake. Specific scents are often associated with our memories of places and events. Thats because scents are more novel or specific than shapes or other things you might see. So an odor similar to that of your grandmothers kitchen or pantry might be more quickly associated with your memories of that place than a similar sight, which might be more generalized.",

        "context": "Water pollution contributes to water shortages by making some water sources unavailable for use. In underdeveloped countries, raw sewage is dumped into the same water that people drink and bathe in. Even in developed countries, water pollution affects human and environmental health. Water pollution includes any contaminant that gets into lakes, streams, and oceans. The most widespread source of water contamination in developing countries is raw sewage. In developed countries, the three main sources of water pollution are described below.  Wastewater from cities and towns contains many different contaminants from many different homes, businesses, and industries (Figure 1.1). Contaminants come from: Sewage disposal (some sewage is inadequately treated or untreated). Storm drains. Septic tanks (sewage from homes). Boats that dump sewage. Yard runoff (fertilizer and herbicide waste). Large numbers of sewage spills into San Francisco Bay are forcing cities, water agencies and the public to take a closer look at wastewater and its impacts on the health of the bay. QUEST investigates the causes of the spills and whats being done to prevent them. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Factories and hospitals spew pollutants into the air and waterways (Figure 1.2). Some of the most hazardous industrial pollutants include: Radioactive substances from nuclear power plants and medical and scientific sources. Heavy metals, organic toxins, oils, and solids in industrial waste. Chemicals, such as sulfur, from burning fossil fuels. Oil and other petroleum products from supertanker spills and offshore drilling accidents. Heated water from industrial processes, such as power stations.  Runoff from crops, livestock, and poultry farming carries contaminants such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste into nearby waterways (Figure 1.3). Soil and silt also run off farms. Animal wastes may carry harmful diseases, particularly in the developing world. The high density of animals in a factory farm means that runoff from the area is full of pollutants. Fertilizers that run off of lawns and farm fields are extremely harmful to the environment. Nutrients, such as nitrates, in the fertilizer promote algae growth in the water they flow into. With the excess nutrients, lakes, rivers, and bays become clogged with algae and aquatic plants. Eventually these organisms die and decompose. Decomposition uses up all the dissolved oxygen in the water. Without oxygen, large numbers of plants, fish, and bottom-dwelling animals die.",

        "context": "Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Air quality, in turn, depends on many factors. Some natural processes add pollutants to the air. For example, forest fires and volcanoes add carbon dioxide and soot. In dry areas, the air often contains dust. However, human actions cause the most air pollution. The single biggest cause is fossil fuel burning.  Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. The machines in factories burned coal. This released a lot of pollutants into the air. After 1900, motor vehicles became common. Cars and trucks burn gasoline, which adds greatly to air pollution.  By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad. The worst incident came in December 1952. A temperature inversion over London, England, kept cold air and pollutants near the ground. The air became so polluted that thousands of people died in just a few days. This event was called the Big Smoke.  At the same time, many U.S. cities had air pollution problems. Some of the worst were in California. Cars were becoming more popular. Oil refineries and power plants also polluted the air. Mountain ranges trapped polluted air over cities. The California sunshine caused chemical reactions among the pollutants. These reactions produced many more harmful compounds.  By 1970, it was clear that something needed to be done to protect air quality. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be released into the air. As a result, the air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles, factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.  There are two basic types of pollutants in air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.  Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by human activities. They pour into the air from vehicles and smokestacks. Several of these pollutants are described below. Carbon oxides include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn. Nitrogen oxides include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ). Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants. Sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO3 ). Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal burns. Coal can contain up to 10 percent sulfur. Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury is used in some industrial processes. It is also found in fluorescent light bulbs. Lead was once widely used in gasoline, paint, and pipes. It is still found in some products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds such as methane. VOCs are released in many human activities, such as raising livestock. Livestock wastes produce a lot of methane. Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil fuels burn (see Figure 22.1).  Secondary pollutants form when primary pollutants undergo chemical reactions after they are released. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants react together in the presence of sunlight. You can see smog hanging in the air over San Francisco in Figure 22.2. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3 ). The ozone in smog is the same compound as the ozone in the ozone layer,(O3 ). But ozone in smog is found near the ground. Figure 22.3 shows how it forms. When nitrogen oxides and VOCs are heated by the Sun, they lose oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms combine with molecules of oxygen to form ozone. Smog ozone is harmful to humans and other living things.  Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released when forests burn.",

        "context": "The history of the atom begins around 450 B.C. with a Greek philosopher named Democritus (see Figure 5.7). Democritus wondered what would happen if you cut a piece of matter, such as an apple, into smaller and smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be reached where matter could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these \"uncuttable\" pieces atomos. This is where the modern term atom comes from. Democritus was an important philosopher. However, he was less influential than the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democrituss idea of atoms. In fact, Aristotle thought  Around 1800, a British chemist named John Dalton revived Democrituss early ideas about the atom. Dalton is pictured in Figure 5.8. He made a living by teaching and just did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research results, he developed one of the most important theories in science.  Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for atoms. For example, he studied the pressure of gases. He concluded that gases must consist of tiny particles in constant motion. Dalton also researched the properties of compounds. He showed that a compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio. On the other hand, different compounds always consist of different elements or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are made of tiny particles that can combine in an endless variety of ways. From his research, Dalton developed a theory of the atom. You can learn more about Dalton and his research by watching the video at this URL:  (9:03). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The atomic theory Dalton developed consists of three ideas: All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of matter. They cannot be divided into smaller particles. They also cannot be created or destroyed. All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass. Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses. Atoms join together to form compounds. A given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same ratio. Daltons theory was soon widely accepted. Most of it is still accepted today. The only part that is no longer accepted is his idea that atoms are the smallest particles. Scientists now know that atoms consist of even smaller particles.  Dalton incorrectly thought that atoms are tiny solid particles of matter. He used solid wooden balls to model them. The sketch in the Figure 5.9 shows how Daltons model atoms looked. He made holes in the balls so they could be joined together with hooks. In this way, the balls could be used to model compounds. When later scientists discovered subatomic particles (particles smaller than the atom itself), they realized that Daltons models were too simple. They didnt show that atoms consist of even smaller particles. Models including these smaller particles were later developed.  The next major advance in the history of the atom was the discovery of electrons. These were the first subatomic particles to be identified. They were discovered in 1897 by a British physicist named J. J. Thomson. You can learn more about Thomson and his discovery at this online exhibit:  .  Thomson was interested in electricity. He did experiments in which he passed an electric current through a vacuum tube. The experiments are described in Figure 5.10. Thomsons experiments showed that an electric current consists of flowing, negatively charged particles. Why was this discovery important? Many scientists of Thomsons time thought that electric current consists of rays, like rays of light, and that it is positive rather than negative. Thomsons experiments also showed that the negative particles are all alike and smaller than atoms. Thomson concluded that the negative particles couldnt be fundamental units of matter because they are all alike. Instead, they must be parts of atoms. The negative particles were later named electrons.  Thomson knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge. So how could atoms contain negative particles? Thomson thought that the rest of the atom must be positive to cancel out the negative charge. He said that an atom is like",

        "context": "A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. A chemical reaction can be represented by this general equation: Reactants ! Products The arrow (!) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. The reaction may occur quickly or slowly. For example, foam shoots out of a fire extinguisher as soon as the lever is pressed. But it might take years for metal to rust.  In chemical reactions, bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. The reactants and prod- ucts contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. Look at the example in Figure 8.2. It shows how water forms. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products, there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. But the atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: http://w  The arrow in Figure 8.2 shows that the reaction goes from left to right, from hydrogen and oxygen to water. The reaction can also go in the reverse direction. If an electric current passes through water, water molecules break down into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction would be represented by a right-to-left arrow ( ) in Figure Many other reactions can also go in both forward and reverse directions. Often, a point is reached at which the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products. This point is called equilibrium, which refers to a balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this URL:  Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. For example, there are no chemical reactions involved in changes of state. When liquid water freezes or evaporates, it is still water. No bonds are broken and no new products are formed. How can you tell whether a change in matter involves a chemical reaction? Often, there is evidence. Four common signs that a chemical reaction has occurred are: Change in color: the products are a different color than the reactants. Change in temperature: heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas: gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid: a solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

        "context": "Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.  About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory.  In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense. It began to cool. First protons, neutrons, and electrons formed. From these particles came hydrogen. Nuclear fusion created helium atoms. Some parts of the universe had matter that was densely packed. Enormous clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually this material became the gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today.  We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.  We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up",

        "context": "A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. A chemical reaction can be represented by this general equation: Reactants ! Products The arrow (!) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. The reaction may occur quickly or slowly. For example, foam shoots out of a fire extinguisher as soon as the lever is pressed. But it might take years for metal to rust.  In chemical reactions, bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. The reactants and prod- ucts contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. Look at the example in Figure 8.2. It shows how water forms. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products, there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. But the atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: http://w  The arrow in Figure 8.2 shows that the reaction goes from left to right, from hydrogen and oxygen to water. The reaction can also go in the reverse direction. If an electric current passes through water, water molecules break down into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction would be represented by a right-to-left arrow ( ) in Figure Many other reactions can also go in both forward and reverse directions. Often, a point is reached at which the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products. This point is called equilibrium, which refers to a balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this URL:  Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. For example, there are no chemical reactions involved in changes of state. When liquid water freezes or evaporates, it is still water. No bonds are broken and no new products are formed. How can you tell whether a change in matter involves a chemical reaction? Often, there is evidence. Four common signs that a chemical reaction has occurred are: Change in color: the products are a different color than the reactants. Change in temperature: heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas: gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid: a solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

        "context": "Vitamins and minerals are also nutrients. They do not provide energy, but they are needed for good health.  Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 13 different vitamins. Some of them are listed below ( Table 1.1). The table also shows how much of each vitamin you need every day. Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps maintain good vision. Vitamin B9 helps form red blood cells. Vitamin K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound. Vitamin Necessary for Available from Daily Amount Required (at ages 913 years) Vitamin Necessary for Available from A Good vision B1 Healthy nerves B3 Healthy skin and nerves B9 Red blood cells B12 Healthy nerves C Growth and repair of tis- sues Healthy bones and teeth Blood to clot Carrots, spinach, milk, eggs Whole wheat, peas, meat, beans, fish, peanuts Beets, liver, pork, turkey, fish, peanuts Liver, peas, dried beans, leafy green vegetables Meat, liver, milk, shell- fish, eggs Oranges, grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli Milk, salmon, tuna, eggs Spinach, brussels sprouts, milk, eggs D K Daily Amount Required (at ages 913 years) 600 g (1 g = 1  106 g) 0.9 mg (1 mg = 1  103 g) 12 mg 300 g 1.8 g 45 mg 5 g 60 g Some vitamins are produced in the body. For example, vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Vitamins B12 and K are produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other vitamins must come from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( Table 1.1). Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too little vitamin C causes a disease called scurvy. People with scurvy have bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms.  Minerals are chemical elements that are needed for body processes. Minerals that you need in relatively large amounts are listed below ( Table 1.2). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and zinc. Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are needed for strong bones and teeth. Potassium and sodium are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally. Mineral Necessary for Available from Calcium Strong bones and teeth Chloride Magnesium Proper balance of water and salts in body Strong bones Phosphorus Strong bones and teeth Potassium Muscles and nerves to work normally Muscles and nerves to work normally Milk, soy milk, leafy green vegetables Table salt, most packaged foods Whole grains, leafy green vegetables, nuts Meat, poultry, whole grains Meats, grains, bananas, orange juice Table salt, most packaged foods Sodium Daily Amount Required (at ages 913 years) 1,300 mg 2.3 g 240 mg 1,250 mg 4.5 g 1.5 g Your body cannot produce any of the minerals that it needs. Instead, you must get minerals from the foods you eat. Good sources of minerals include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( Table 1.2). Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too little calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which bones become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium causes high blood pressure in some people.",

        "context": "Mercury is the smallest planet. It has no moon. The planet is also closest to the Sun and appears in Figure 25.7. As Figure 25.8 shows, the surface of Mercury is covered with craters, like Earths Moon. The presence of impact craters that are so old means that Mercury hasnt changed much geologically for billions of years. With only a trace of an atmosphere, it has no weather to wear down the ancient craters. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difficult to observe from Earth, even with a telescope. The Mariner 10 spacecraft did a flyby of Mercury in 19741975, which was the best data from the planet for decades. In 2004, the MESSENGER mission left Earth. On its way to Mercury it did one flyby of Earth, two of Venus and three of Mercury. In March 2011, MESSENGER became the first spacecraft to enter an orbit around Mercury. During its year-long mission, the craft will map the planets surface and conduct other studies. One of these images can be seen in Figure 25.9.  Mercury is named for the Roman messenger god. Mercury was a messenger because he could run extremely fast. The Greeks gave the planet this name because Mercury moves very quickly in its orbit around the Sun. Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury has a very short year, but it also has very long days. Mercury rotates slowly on its axis, turning exactly three times for every two times it orbits the Sun. Therefore, each day on Mercury is 58 Earth days long.  Mercury is very close to the Sun, so it can get very hot. Mercury also has virtually no atmosphere. As the planet rotates very slowly, the temperature varies tremendously. In direct sunlight, the surface can be as hot as 427C (801F). On the dark side, the surface can be as cold as 183C (297F)! The coldest temperatures may be on the insides of craters. Most of Mercury is extremely dry. Scientists think that there may be a small amount of water, in the form of ice, at the planets poles. The poles never receive direct sunlight.  Figure 25.10 shows a diagram of Mercurys interior. Mercury is one of the densest planets. Scientists think that the interior contains a large core made mostly of melted iron. Mercurys core takes up about 42% of the planets volume. Mercurys highly cratered surface is evidence that Mercury is not geologically active.  Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the only planet named after a female. Venus is sometimes called Earths sister planet. But just how similar is Venus to Earth? Venus is our nearest neighbor. Venus is most like Earth in size.  Viewed through a telescope, Venus looks smooth and featureless. The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds. You can see the clouds in pictures of Venus, such as Figure 25.11. We make maps of the surface using radar, because the thick clouds wont allow us to take photographs of the surface of Venus. Figure 25.12 shows the topographical features of Venus. The image was produced by the Magellan probe on a flyby. Radar waves sent by the spacecraft reveal mountains, valleys, vast lava plains, and canyons. Like Mercury, Venus does not have a moon. Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venuss clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earths surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465C (860F). Thats hot enough to melt lead!  Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet. There are between 100,000 and one million volcanoes on Venus! Most of the volcanoes are now inactive. There are also a large number of craters. This means",

        "context": "In an endothermic reaction, it takes more energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. The word \"endothermic\" literally means \"taking in heat.\" A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed in an endothermic reaction. Not enough energy is released when products form to break more bonds in the reactants. Additional energy is needed to keep the reaction going. The general equation for an endothermic reaction is: Reactants + Energy ! Products In many endothermic reactions, heat is absorbed from the surroundings. As a result, the temperature drops. The drop in temperature may be great enough to cause liquid products to freeze. Thats what happens in the endothermic reaction at this URL:  One of the most important endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. In this reaction, plants synthesize glucose (C6 H12 O6 ) from carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and water (H2 O). They also release oxygen (O2 ). The energy for photo- synthesis comes from light (see Figure 8.12). Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2 O ! C6 H12 O6 + 6O2  In an exothermic reaction, it takes less energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. The word \"exothermic\" literally means \"turning out heat.\" Energy, often in the form of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction occurs. The general equation for an exothermic reaction is: Reactants ! Products + Energy If the energy is released as heat, an exothermic reaction results in a rise in temperature. Thats what happens in the exothermic reaction at the URL below. Combustion reactions are examples of exothermic reactions. When substances burn, they usually give off energy as heat and light. Look at the big bonfire in Figure 8.13. You can see the light energy it is giving off. If you were standing near the fire, you would also feel its heat.  Whether a reaction absorbs energy or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is the law of conservation of energy. Energy can change form for example, from electricity to light but the same amount of energy always remains. If energy cannot be destroyed, what happens to the energy that is absorbed in an endothermic reaction? The energy is stored in the chemical bonds of the products. This form of energy is called chemical energy. In an endothermic reaction, the products have more stored chemical energy than the reactants. In an exothermic reaction, the opposite is true. The products have less stored chemical energy than the reactants. The excess energy in the reactants is released to the surroundings when the reaction occurs. The graphs in Figure 8.14 show the chemical energy of reactants and products in each type of reaction.  All chemical reactions, even exothermic reactions, need a certain amount of energy to get started. This energy is called activation energy. For example, activation energy is needed to start a car. Turning the key causes a spark that activates the burning of gasoline in the engine. The combustion of gas wont occur without the spark of energy to begin the reaction. Why is activation energy needed? A reaction wont occur unless atoms or molecules of reactants come together. This happens only if the particles are moving, and movement takes energy. Often, reactants have to overcome forces that push them apart. This takes energy as well. Still more energy is needed to start breaking bonds in reactants. The graphs in Figure 8.15 show the changes in energy in endothermic and exothermic reactions. Both reactions need the same amount of activation energy in order to begin. You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction. For example, if youve ever used a match to light a campfire, then you provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction. Combustion is exothermic. Once a fire starts to burn, it releases enough energy to activate the next reaction, and the next, and so on. However, wood will not burst",

A pedigree is commonly created for families, and it outlines the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders and traits. A pedigree can help predict the probability that offspring will inherit a genetic disorder. Pictured below is a pedigree displaying recessive inheritance of a disorder through three generations ( Figure 1.1). From studying a pedigree, scientists can determine the following: If the trait is sex-linked (on the X or Y chromosome) or autosomal (on a chromosome that does not determine sex). If the trait is inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion. Sometimes pedigrees can also help determine whether individuals with the trait are heterozygous (two different alleles) or homozygous (two of the same allele). Some points to keep in mind when analyzing a pedigree are: 1. With autosomal recessive inheritance, all affected individuals will be homozygous recessive. 2. With dominant inheritance, all affected individuals will have at least one dominant allele. They will be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. 3. With sex-linked inheritance, more males (XY) than females (XX) usually have the trait. Sex-linked inheritance is usually recessive.",

If they look only at the other children sitting near them, they will not appear to be moving. They may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by.

URL:  Did you ever go to a track meet like the one pictured in Figure 12.3? Running events in track include 100-meter sprints and 2000-meter races. Races are named for their distance. Distance is the length of the route between two points. The length of the route in a race is the distance between the starting and finishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, for example, the distance is 100 meters.  The SI unit for distance is the meter (1 m = 3.28 ft). Short distances may be measured in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m). Long distances may be measured in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m). For example, you might measure the distance a frogs tongue moves in centimeters and the distance a cheetah moves in kilometers.  Maps can often be used to measure distance. Look at the map in Figure 12.4. Find Mias house and the school. You can use the map key to directly measure the distance between these two points. The distance is 2 kilometers. Measure it yourself to see if you agree.  Things dont always move in straight lines like the route from Mias house to the school. Sometimes they change direction as they move. For example, the route from Mias house to the post office changes from west to north at the school (see Figure 12.4). To find the total distance of a route that changes direction, you must add up the distances traveled in each direction. From Mias house to the school, for example, the distance is 2 kilometers. From the school to the post office, the distance is 1 kilometer. Therefore, the total distance from Mias house to the post office is 3 kilometers. You Try It! Problem: What is the distance from the post office to the park in Figure 12.4? Direction is just as important as distance in describing motion. For example, if Mia told a friend how to reach the post office from her house, she couldnt just say, \"go 3 kilometers.\" The friend might end up at the park instead of the post office. Mia would have to be more specific. She could say, \"go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.\" When both distance and direction are considered, motion is a vector. A vector is a quantity that includes both size and direction. A vector is represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents distance. The way the arrow points shows direction.

        "context": "The history of the atom begins around 450 B.C. with a Greek philosopher named Democritus (see Figure 5.7). Democritus wondered what would happen if you cut a piece of matter, such as an apple, into smaller and smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be reached where matter could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these \"uncuttable\" pieces atomos. This is where the modern term atom comes from. Democritus was an important philosopher. However, he was less influential than the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived about 100 years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democrituss idea of atoms. In fact, Aristotle thought  Around 1800, a British chemist named John Dalton revived Democrituss early ideas about the atom. Dalton is pictured in Figure 5.8. He made a living by teaching and just did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research results, he developed one of the most important theories in science.  Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for atoms. For example, he studied the pressure of gases. He concluded that gases must consist of tiny particles in constant motion. Dalton also researched the properties of compounds. He showed that a compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio. On the other hand, different compounds always consist of different elements or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are made of tiny particles that can combine in an endless variety of ways. From his research, Dalton developed a theory of the atom. You can learn more about Dalton and his research by watching the video at this URL:  (9:03). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The atomic theory Dalton developed consists of three ideas: All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles of matter. They cannot be divided into smaller particles. They also cannot be created or destroyed. All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass. Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses. Atoms join together to form compounds. A given compound always consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same ratio. Daltons theory was soon widely accepted. Most of it is still accepted today. The only part that is no longer accepted is his idea that atoms are the smallest particles. Scientists now know that atoms consist of even smaller particles.  Dalton incorrectly thought that atoms are tiny solid particles of matter. He used solid wooden balls to model them. The sketch in the Figure 5.9 shows how Daltons model atoms looked. He made holes in the balls so they could be joined together with hooks. In this way, the balls could be used to model compounds. When later scientists discovered subatomic particles (particles smaller than the atom itself), they realized that Daltons models were too simple. They didnt show that atoms consist of even smaller particles. Models including these smaller particles were later developed.  The next major advance in the history of the atom was the discovery of electrons. These were the first subatomic particles to be identified. They were discovered in 1897 by a British physicist named J. J. Thomson. You can learn more about Thomson and his discovery at this online exhibit:  .  Thomson was interested in electricity. He did experiments in which he passed an electric current through a vacuum tube. The experiments are described in Figure 5.10. Thomsons experiments showed that an electric current consists of flowing, negatively charged particles. Why was this discovery important? Many scientists of Thomsons time thought that electric current consists of rays, like rays of light, and that it is positive rather than negative. Thomsons experiments also showed that the negative particles are all alike and smaller than atoms. Thomson concluded that the negative particles couldnt be fundamental units of matter because they are all alike. Instead, they must be parts of atoms. The negative particles were later named electrons.  Thomson knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge. So how could atoms contain negative particles? Thomson thought that the rest of the atom must be positive to cancel out the negative charge. He said that an atom is like",

        "context": "Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.  About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory.  In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense. It began to cool. First protons, neutrons, and electrons formed. From these particles came hydrogen. Nuclear fusion created helium atoms. Some parts of the universe had matter that was densely packed. Enormous clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually this material became the gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today.  We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.  We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up",

        "context": "A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the one below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to products (on the right). Reactants  Products Chemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly. Look at the two pictures in the Figure 1.1. Both represent chemical reactions. In the picture on the left, a reaction inside a fire extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the extinguisher. This reaction occurs almost instantly. In the picture on the right, a reaction causes the iron tool to turn to rust. This reaction occurs very slowly. In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the tool to turn to rust. Q: What happens during a chemical reaction? Where do the reactants go, and where do the products come from? A: During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place. Some chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.  The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. This happens because chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products. Consider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and hydrogen gases. The Figure 1.2 represents this reaction. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the atoms are combined differently in water.  The chemical reaction in the Figure 1.2, in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a synthesis reaction. In this type of reaction, two or more reactants combine to synthesize a single product. There are several other types of chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions. The Table 1.1 compares these four types of chemical reactions. Type of Reaction Synthesis Decomposition General Equation A+B  C AB  A + B Example 2Na + Cl2  2NaCl 2H2 O 2H2 + O2 Type of Reaction Single Replacement Double Replacement Combustion General Equation A+BC  B+ AC AB+ CD  AD + CB fuel + oxygen  carbon dioxide + water Example 2K + 2H2 O  2KOH + H2 NaCl+ AgF  NaF + AgCl CH4 + 2O2  CO2 + 2H2 O Q: The burning of wood is a chemical reaction. Which type of reaction is it? A: The burning of woodor of anything elseis a combustion reaction. In the combustion example in the table, the fuel is methane gas (CH4 ). Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In terms of energy, there are two types of chemical reactions: endothermic reactions and exothermic reactions. In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when bonds form in products than is used to break bonds in reactants. These reactions release energy to the environment, often in the form of heat or light. In endothermic reactions, more energy is used to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These reactions absorb energy from the environment. Q: When it comes to energy, which type of reaction is the burning of wood? Is it an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction? How can you tell? A: The burning of wood is an exothermic reaction. You can tell by the heat and light energy given off by a wood fire.",

        "context": "The Sun is Earths main source of energy. The Sun gives us both light and heat. The Sun changes hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion. This releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to the Earth mostly as visible light. The energy is carried through the empty space by radiation. We can use sunlight as an energy resource, called solar energy (Figure 5.7).  Solar energy has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Today we are using solar energy for more of our power demands. Solar power plants are being built in many locations around the world. In the United States, the southwestern deserts are well suited for solar plants.  Sunlight is turned into electricity at a solar power plant. These power plants use a large group of mirrors to focus sunlight on one place. This place is called a receiver (Figure 5.8). At the receiver, a liquid such as oil or water is heated to a high temperature. The liquid transfers its heat by conduction. In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are in contact. The higher temperature object transfers heat to the lower temperature object. For example, when you heat a pot of water on a stove top, energy moves from the pot to its metal handle by conduction. At a solar power plant, the energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.  Solar energy is used to heat homes and water, and to make electricity. Scientists and engineers have many ways to get energy from the Sun (Figure 5.9). One is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that turn sunlight directly into electricity. Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel. You may have seen solar panels on roof tops. The Suns heat can also be trapped in your home by using south facing windows and good insulation.  Solar energy has many benefits. It does not produce any pollution. There is plenty of it available, much more than we could possibly use. But solar energy has problems. The Sun doesnt shine at night. A special battery is needed to store extra energy during the day for use at night. The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until solar technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources.  Moving water has energy (Figure 5.10). That energy is used to make electricity. Hydroelectric power harnesses the energy of water moving down a stream. Hydropower is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world. This abundant energy source provides almost one fifth of the worlds electricity. The energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power. At this time, wave and tidal power are rare.  To harness water power, a stream must be dammed. Narrow valleys are the best for dams. While sitting in the reservoir behind the dam, the water has potential energy. Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large turbine. While flowing downhill, the water has kinetic energy. Kinetic energy makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity.  Many of the suitable streams in the United States have been developed for hydroelectric power. Many streams worldwide also have hydroelectric plants. Hydropower is a major source of Californias electricity. It accounts for about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of Californias nearly 400 hydroelectric power plants are located in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Water power does not burn a fuel. So it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy. Water power is also a renewable resource. Water keeps flowing downhill. Although we use some of the energy from this movement, we are not using up the water. Water power does have problems. A large dam stops a streams flow, which floods the land upstream. A beautiful location may be lost. People may be displaced. The dams and turbines also change the downstream environment. Fish and other living things may not be able to survive. Dams slow the release of silt. Downstream deltas retreat and beaches may be starved of sand. Seaside cities may become exposed to storms and",

        "context": "Flatworms are invertebrates that belong to Phylum Platyhelminthes. There are more than 25,000 species in the flatworm phylum. Not all flatworms are as long as tapeworms. Some are only about a millimeter in length.  Flatworms have a flat body because they lack a fluid-filled body cavity. They also have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. However, flatworms represent several evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have the following adaptations: Flatworms have three embryonic cell layers. They have a mesoderm layer in addition to ectoderm and endoderm layers. The mesoderm layer allows flatworms to develop muscle tissues so they can move easily over solid surfaces. Flatworms have a concentration of nerve tissue in the head end. This was a major step in the evolution of a brain. It was also needed for bilateral symmetry. Flatworms have bilateral symmetry. This gives them a better sense of direction than radial symmetry would.

URL:  Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adults body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form. Then the life cycle repeats.  Some flatworms live in water or moist soil. They eat invertebrates and decaying animals. Other flatworms, such as tapeworms, are parasites that live inside vertebrate hosts. Usually, more than one type of host is needed to complete the parasites life cycle, as shown in Figure 12.12.  Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse phylum. It has more than 80,000 known species. Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters in length. You can see an example of a roundworm in Figure 12.13.  Roundworms have a round body because they have a partial fluid-filled body cavity (pseudocoelom). This is one way that roundworms differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to eat, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in their partial body cavity. The fluid pressure adds stiffness to the body. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles, allowing roundworms to move easily over surfaces.  Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the life cycle repeats.  Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic organisms. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in moist soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate hosts. Several roundworm species infect humans. Besides ascaris, they include hookworms. Hookworms are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hosts intestines. You can see the hooks in Figure 12.14. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Female adults lay large quantities of eggs. Eggs pass out of the host in feces. Eggs hatch into larvae in the feces or soil. Then the cycle repeats. You can learn more about parasitic roundworms in humans by watching this short video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:",

        "context": "Some minerals are very useful. An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore (Figure 1.1) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and refining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes is often not figured into a products cost. It is important to use mineral resources wisely.  Geologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable natural resources. Geologists study geological formations and then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate possible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral deposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of minerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine. There are many ways to mine ores. Aluminum is made from the aluminum- bearing minerals in bauxite.  Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earths surface. Overlying rock is blasted and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery. As pictured in Figure 1.2, surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging. Strip mining is like open pit mining but with material removed along a strip. These different forms of surface mining are methods of extracting ores close to Earths surface. Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. Californias nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard metamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada, which also contains deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable minerals. The  Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earths surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached  from above, below, or sideways  depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding rock. Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners, and accidents are far too common.  The ores journey to becoming a useable material is only just beginning when the ore leaves the mine (Figure separated out of the ore. A few methods for extracting ore are: heap leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or acid, to remove ore. flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. smelting: roasting rock, causing it to segregate into layers so the mineral can be extracted. To extract the metal from the ore, the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900o C, which requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy-intensive that if you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.",

The shells you find are most likely left by organisms in the phylum Mollusca. On the beach, you can find the shells of many different mollusks ( Figure 1.1), including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails. Mollusks are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a radula. Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and abalone shells are like pieces of jewelry. Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not have shells.  The Mollusks body is often divided into different parts ( Figure 1.2): On the beach, you can find a wide variety of mollusk shells. 1. A head with eyes or tentacles. 2. In most species, a muscular foot, which helps the mollusk move. Some mollusks use the foot for burrowing into the sand, and others use it for jet-propulsion. 3. A mantle, or fold of the outer skin lining the shell. The mantle often releases calcium carbonate, which creates an external shell, just like the ones you find on the beach. The shell is made of chitin, a tough, semitransparent substance. 4. A mass housing the organs. 5. A complete digestive tract that begins at the mouth and runs to the anus. 6. Most ocean mollusks have a gill or gills to absorb oxygen from the water. 7. Many species have a feeding structure, the radula, found only in mollusks. The radula can be thought of as a \"tongue-like\" structure. The radula is made mostly of chitin. Types of radulae range from structures used to scrape algae off of rocks to the beaks of squid and octopuses. This is the basic body plan of a mollusk. Note the mantle, gills, and radula. Keep in mind the basic body plan can differ slightly among the mollusks.  Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum Annelida, also known as segmented worms. This phylum includes the earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have body segmentation. The basic mollusk body shape is usually quite different as well.",

        "context": "Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7. For a funny, fast-paced overview of fungi, watch this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants.  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.  The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land.  Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.  Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below.  During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.  Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents.",

        "context": "Every major advance in agriculture has allowed global population to increase. Early farmers could settle down to a steady food supply. Irrigation, the ability to clear large swaths of land for farming efficiently, and the development of farm machines powered by fossil fuels allowed people to grow more food and transport it to where it was needed.  What is Earths carrying capacity for humans? Are humans now exceeding Earths carrying capacity for our species? Many anthropologists say that the carrying capacity of humans on the planet without agriculture is about 10 million (Figure 1.1). This population was reached about 10,000 years ago. At the time, people lived together in small bands of hunters and gatherers. Typically men hunted and fished; women gathered nuts and vegetables. Obviously, human populations have blown past this hypothetical carrying capacity. By using our brains, our erect posture, and our hands, we have been able to manipulate our environment in ways that no other species has ever done. What have been the important developments that have allowed population to grow?  About 10,000 years ago, we developed the ability to grow our own food. Farming increased the yield of food plants and allowed people to have food available year round. Animals were domesticated to provide meat. With agriculture, people could settle down, so that they no longer needed to carry all their possessions (Figure 1.2). They could develop better farming practices and store food for when it was difficult to grow. Agriculture allowed people to settle in towns and cities. More advanced farming practices allowed a single farmer to grow food for many more people. When advanced farming practices allowed farmers to grow more food than they needed for their families (Figure  The next major stage in the growth of the human population was the Industrial Revolution, which started in the late 1700s (Figure 1.4). This major historical event marks when products were first mass-produced and when fossil fuels were first widely used for power.  The Green Revolution has allowed the addition of billions of people to the population in the past few decades. The Green Revolution has improved agricultural productivity by: Improving crops by selecting for traits that promote productivity; recently, genetically engineered crops have been introduced. Increasing the use of artificial fertilizers and chemical pesticides. About 23 times more fertilizer and 50 times more pesticides are used around the world than were used just 50 years ago (Figure 1.5). Agricultural machinery: plowing, tilling, fertilizing, picking, and transporting are all done by machines. About 17% of the energy used each year in the United States is for agriculture. Increasing access to water. Many farming regions depend on groundwater, which is not a renewable resource. Some regions will eventually run out of this water source. Currently about 70% of the worlds fresh water is used for agriculture. Rows of a single crop and heavy ma- chinery are normal sights for modern day farms. The Green Revolution has increased the productivity of farms immensely. A century ago, a single farmer produced enough food for 2.5 people, but now a farmer can feed more than 130 people. The Green Revolution is credited for feeding 1 billion people that would not otherwise have been able to live.  The flip side to this is that for the population to continue to grow, more advances in agriculture and an ever increasing supply of water will be needed. Weve increased the carrying capacity for humans by our genius: growing crops, trading for needed materials, and designing ways to exploit resources that are difficult to get at, such as groundwater. And most of these resources are limited. The question is, even though we have increased the carrying capacity of the planet, have we now exceeded it (Figure There is not yet an answer to that question, but there are many different opinions. In the eighteenth century, Thomas Malthus predicted that human population would continue to grow until we had exhausted our resources. At that point, humans would become victims of famine, disease, or war. This has not happened, at least not yet. Some scientists think that the carrying capacity of the planet is about 1 billion people, not the 7 billion people we have today",

        "context": "A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.  Ores have high concentrations of valuable minerals. Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. To find an ore deposit, geologists will go to a likely spot. They then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks. Ore deposits contain valuable minerals. They may also contain other chemical elements that indicate an ore deposit is nearby. After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They outline the deposit and the surrounding geology on a map. The miners calculate the amount of valuable minerals they think they will get from the deposit. The minerals will only be mined if it is profitable. If it is profitable, they must then decide on the way it should be mined. The two main methods of mining are surface mining and underground mining. Placers are a type of surface deposit.  Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.  Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction.  If an ore is deep below Earths surface it may be too expensive to remove all the rock above it. These deposits are taken by underground mining. Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 m deep (that is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining. Tunnels must be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fresh air and lights must be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. The miners breathe in lots of particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the surrounding rock and taken out of the tunnels. Sometimes there are explosions as ore is being drilled or blasted. This can lead to a mine collapse. Miners may be hurt or killed in a mining accident.  Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans,",

        "context": "Biotic and abiotic factors determine the population size of a species in an ecosystem. What are some important biotic factors? Biotic factors include the amount of food that is available to that species and the number of organisms that also use that food source. What are some important abiotic factors? Space, water, and climate all help determine a species population. When does a population grow? A population grows when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths. When does a population shrink? When deaths exceed births. What causes a population to grow? For a population to grow there must be ample resources and no major problems. What causes a population to shrink? A population can shrink either because of biotic or abiotic limits. An increase in predators, the emergence of a new disease, or the loss of habitat are just three possible problems that will decrease a population. A population may also shrink if it grows too large for the resources required to support it.  When the number of births equals the number of deaths, the population is at its carrying capacity for that habitat. In a population at its carrying capacity, there are as many organisms of that species as the habitat can support. The carrying capacity depends on biotic and abiotic factors. If these factors improve, the carrying capacity increases. If the factors become less plentiful, the carrying capacity drops. If resources are being used faster than they are being replenished, then the species has exceeded its carrying capacity. If this occurs, the population will then decrease in size.  Every stable population has one or more factors that limit its growth. A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species. A limiting factor can be any biotic or abiotic factor: nutrient, space, and water availability are examples (Figure 1.1). The size of a population is tied to its limiting factor. What happens if a limiting factor increases a lot? Is it still a limiting factor? If a limiting factor increases a lot, another factor will most likely become the new limiting factor. This may be a bit confusing, so lets look at an example of limiting factors. Say you want to make as many chocolate chip cookies as you can with the ingredients you have on hand. It turns out that you have plenty of flour and other ingredients, but only two eggs. You can make only one batch of cookies, because eggs are the limiting factor. But then your neighbor comes over with a dozen eggs. Now you have enough eggs for seven batches of cookies, but only two pounds of butter. You can make four batches of cookies, with butter as the limiting factor. If you get more butter, some other ingredient will be limiting. Species ordinarily produce more offspring than their habitat can support (Figure 1.2). If conditions improve, more young survive and the population grows. If conditions worsen, or if too many young are born, there is competition between individuals. As in any competition, there are some winners and some losers. Those individuals that survive to fill the available spots in the niche are those that are the most fit for their habitat. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A frog in frog spawn.

        "context": "Elements form compounds when they combine chemically. Their atoms join together to form molecules, crystals, or other structures. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. It occurs when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom. You can learn more about chemical bonds in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Look at the example of water in Figure 7.1. A water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms share their two electrons with the six valence electrons of one oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. This gives it a more stable arrangement of electrons that takes less energy to maintain.  Water (H2 O) is an example of a chemical compound. Water molecules always consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Like water, all other chemical compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesnt matter how much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same composition.  Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Youve already seen the chemical formula for water. Its H2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript.

What is its chemical formula?  The same elements may combine in different ratios. If they do, they form different compounds. Figure 7.2 shows some examples. Both water (H2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) consist of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If youve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Both carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How do their properties differ?  There are different types of compounds. They differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms together. The type of bonds in a compound determines many of its properties. Three types of bonds are ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.

        "context": "Many pieces of evidence can mean that a volcano is about to erupt, but the time and magnitude of the eruption are difficult to pin down. This evidence includes the history of previous volcanic activity, earthquakes, slope deformation, and gas emissions.  A volcanos history  how long since its last eruption and the time span between its previous eruptions  is a good first step to predicting eruptions. Active and dormant volcanoes are heavily monitored, especially in populated areas.  Moving magma shakes the ground, so the number and size of earthquakes increases before an eruption. A volcano that is about to erupt may produce a sequence of earthquakes. Scientists use seismographs that record the length and strength of each earthquake to try to determine if an eruption is imminent.  Magma and gas can push the volcanos slope upward. Most ground deformation is subtle and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano. But ground swelling may sometimes create huge changes in the shape of a volcano. Mount St. Helens grew a bulge on its north side before its 1980 eruption. Ground swelling may also increase rock falls and landslides.  Gases may be able to escape a volcano before magma reaches the surface. Scientists measure gas emissions in vents on or around the volcano. Gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), carbon dioxide (CO2 ), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and even water vapor can be measured at the site (Figure 1.1) or, in some cases, from a distance using satellites. The amounts of gases and their ratios are calculated to help predict eruptions. Scientists monitoring gas emissions at Mount St. Helens.  Some gases can be monitored using satellite technology (Figure 1.2). Satellites also monitor temperature readings and deformation. As technology improves, scientists are better able to detect changes in a volcano accurately and safely.  Since volcanologists are usually uncertain about an eruption, officials may not know whether to require an evac- uation. If people are evacuated and the eruption doesnt happen, the people will be displeased and less likely to evacuate the next time there is a threat of an eruption. The costs of disrupting business are great. However, scientists continue to work to improve the accuracy of their predictions. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        "context": "Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements. To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.  An element is defined by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of a given element contain the same number of protons. The number of neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown in Figure 11.15. Compare their protons and neutrons. Both contain 6 protons. But carbon-12 has 6 neutrons and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. Carbon-14 is unstable. Figure 11.16 shows carbon dioxide, which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Neutrons in cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. The nitrogen forms carbon- 14. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains.  Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an alpha particle. It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14. This is illustrated in Figure 11.17. The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate. This rate is different for each isotope pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years. Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5730 years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14. Over the next 5730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14. How many grams will there be in another 5730 years? Figure 11.18 graphs the rate of decay of carbon-14.  The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of dating is called radiometric dating.  The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating. A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in its body continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on. We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died. Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon- 14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old. Thats a blink of an eye in geologic time. But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites. Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes.  The isotopes in Table 11.1 are used to date igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives than carbon- 14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens. Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago?

        "context": "The Cold War helped scientists to learn more about our planet. They set up seismograph networks during the 1950s and early 1960s. The purpose was to see if other nations were testing atomic bombs. Of course, at the same time, the seismographs were recording earthquakes.  The scientists realized that the earthquakes were most common in certain areas. In the oceans, they were found along mid-ocean ridges and deep sea trenches. Earthquakes and volcanoes were common all around the Pacific Ocean. They named this region the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 6.13). Earthquakes are also common in the worlds highest mountains, the Himalaya Mountains of Asia. The Mediterranean Sea also has many earthquakes.  Earthquakes are used to identify plate boundaries (Figure 6.14). When earthquake locations are put on a map, they outline the plates. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. A few are all continental lithosphere. But  Convection within the Earths mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle material is heated above the core. The hot mantle rises up towards the surface (Figure 6.16). As the mantle rises it cools. At the surface the material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench. The material sinks back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a convection cell.  Plate boundaries are where two plates meet. Most geologic activity takes place at plate boundaries. This activity includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building. The activity occurs as plates interact. How can plates interact? Plates can move away from each other. They can move toward each other. Finally, they can slide past each other. These are the three types of plate boundaries: Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other. Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other. Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other. The features that form at a plate boundary are determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust at the boundary.  Plates move apart at divergent plate boundaries. This can occur in the oceans or on land.  Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Lava rises upward, erupts, and cools. Later, more lava erupts and pushes the original seafloor outward. This is seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading forms new oceanic crust. The rising magma causes earthquakes. Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea. The island of Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Figure 6.17).  A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called continental rifting (Figure 6.18). Magma rises beneath the continent. The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This first produces a rift valley. The East African Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up.  A convergent plate boundary forms where two plates collide. That collision can happen between a continent and oceanic crust, between two oceanic plates, or between two continents. Oceanic crust is always destroyed in these collisions.  Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction. This means that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench (Figure 6.19). Subduction zones are where subduction takes place. As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is called a volcanic arc. The Andes Mountains, along the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc (Figure 6.20).  Two",

        "context": "All volcanoes share the same basic features. First, mantle rock melts. The molten rock collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands. The hot rock is less dense than the surrounding rock. The magma rises toward the surface through cracks in the crust. A volcanic eruption occurs when the magma reaches the surface. Lava can reach the surface gently or explosively.  Eruptions can be explosive or non-explosive. Only rarely do gentle and explosive eruptions happen in the same volcano.  An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be 10,000 times as powerful as an atomic bomb (Figure 8.6). Hot magma beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous explosion. Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, fly up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful worldwide. Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction. Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is Crater Lake (Figure 8.18).  Some volcanic eruptions are non-explosive (Figure 8.7). This happens when there is little or no gas. The lava is thin, fluid and runny. It flows over the ground like a river. People generally have a lot of warning before a lava flow like this reaches them, so non-explosive eruptions are much less deadly. They may still be destructive to property, though. Even when we know that a lava flow is approaching, there are few ways of stopping it!  Great volcanic explosions and glowing red rivers of lava are fascinating. All igneous rock comes from magma or lava. Remember that magma is molten rock that is below Earths surface. Lava is molten rock at Earths surface.  Magma forms deep beneath the Earths surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600o C and 1300o C (Figure 8.8). Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earths surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots. The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. Thicker magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. When magma is fluid and runny, it often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava.  The way lava flows depends on what it is made of. Thick lava doesnt flow easily. It may block the vent of a volcano. If the lava traps a lot of gas, the pressure builds up. After the pressure becomes greater and greater, the volcano finally explodes. Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into the air. Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas bubbles were when the rock was still molten. Fluid lava flows down mountainsides. The rock that the flow becomes depends on which type of lava it is and where it cools. The three types of flows are aa, pahoehoe, and pillow lava. Aa Lava Aa lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas. Aa forms a thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough, rubbly pieces. The solidified surface is angular, jagged and sharp. Aa can",

        "context": "A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy from place to place. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. An example of a mechanical wave is pictured in Figure 19.1. A drop of water falls into a pond. This disturbs the water in the pond. What happens next? The disturbance travels outward from the drop in all directions. This is the wave. A source of energy is needed to start a mechanical wave. In this case, the energy comes from the falling drop of water.  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.  There are three types of mechanical waves. They differ in how they travel through a medium. The three types are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. All three types are described in detail below.  A transverse wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. An example of a transverse wave is a wave in a rope, like the one pictured in Figure 19.2. In this wave, energy is provided by a persons hand moving one end of the rope up and down. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the persons hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can see a brief video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:  . To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL:  (0:22). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A transverse wave can be characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. This is illustrated in Figure 19.3. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.  Another example of transverse waves occurs with earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called secondary, or S, waves. An S wave is illustrated in Figure 19.4.  A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates in the same direction that the wave travels. An example of a longitudinal wave is a wave in a spring, like the one in Figure 19.5. In this wave, the energy is provided by a persons hand pushing and pulling the spring. The coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the disturbance passes through them. The direction of the wave is down the length of the spring, or the same direction in which the coils move. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http  A longitudinal wave can be characterized by the compressions and rarefactions of the medium. This is illustrated in Figure 19.6. Compressions are the places where the coils are crowded together, and rarefactions are the places where the coils are spread apart.  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called primary, or P, waves. They are illustrated in Figure 19.7.  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. It combines a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. Ocean waves are surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean",

        "context": "A biochemical compound is any carbon-based compound found in living things. Like hydrocarbons, all biochemi- cal compounds contain hydrogen as well as carbon. However, biochemical compounds also contain other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. They consist of many, smaller monomer molecules. Biochemical polymers are referred to as macromolecules. The prefix macro means \"large,\" and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of organisms. They are also involved in life processes, such as making and using food for energy. Given their diversity of functions, its not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds. However, they can be grouped into just four main classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The classes are summarized in Table 9.3 and described in the rest of this lesson. Class Carbohydrates Elements carbon hydrogen oxygen Examples sugars starches cellulose Proteins carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur carbon hydrogen oxygen carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus enzymes hormones Lipids Nucleic acids Functions provide energy to cells store energy in plants makes up the cell walls of plants speed up biochemical re- actions regulate life processes fats oils store energy in animals store energy in plants DNA RNA stores genetic information in cells helps cells make proteins  Carbohydrates are biochemical compounds that include sugars, starches, and cellulose. They contain oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Organisms use carbohydrates mainly for energy.  Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugar have just a few carbon atoms. The simplest sugar is glucose (C6 H12 O6 ). Glucose is the sugar that the cells of living things use for energy. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms. You can see the structural formula of glucose and two other sugars in Figure 9.16. The other sugars in the figure are fructose and sucrose. Fructose is an isomer of glucose. It is found in fruits. It has the same atoms as glucose, but they are arranged differently. Sucrose is table sugar. It consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.  Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. They consist of hundreds of glucose monomers bonded together. Plants make starch to store extra sugars. Consumers get starch from plants. Common sources of starch in the human diet are pictured in Figure 9.17. Our digestive system breaks down starch to simple sugars, which our cells use for energy.  Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. However, the glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers (see Figure 9.18). Have you ever eaten raw celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain long, stringy fibers. The fibers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to trunks and stems. Cellulose also provides needed fiber in the human diet. We cant digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract.  Proteins are biochemical compounds that contain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids.  Amino acids are the \"building blocks\" of proteins. There are 20 different common amino acids. The structural formula of the simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in Figure 9.19. Other amino acids have a similar structure. The sequence of amino acids and the number of amino acid chains in a protein determine the proteins shape. The shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function. Shapes may be very complex.

        "context": "Cells were first discovered in the mid-1600s. The cell theory came about some 200 years later. You can see a re- enactment of some of the discoveries that led to the cell theory in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  British scientist Robert Hooke first discovered cells in 1665. He was one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a microscope. He saw that cork was divided into many tiny compartments, like little rooms. (Do the cells in Figure 3.1 look like little rooms to you too?) Hooke called these little rooms cells. Cork comes from trees, so what Hooke observed was dead plant cells. In the late 1600s, Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek made more powerful microscopes. He used them to observe cells of other organisms. For example, he saw human blood cells and bacterial cells. Over the next century, microscopes were improved and more cells were observed.  By the early 1800s, scientists had seen cells in many different types of organisms. Every organism that was examined was found to consist of cells. From all these observations, German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden drew two major conclusions about cells. They concluded that: cells are alive. all living things are made of cells. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was observing living cells under a microscope. As he was watching, one of the cells happened to divide. Figure 3.2 shows a cell dividing, like the cell observed by Virchow. This was an aha moment for Virchow. He realized that living cells produce new cells by dividing. This was evidence that cells arise from other cells. The work of Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow led to the cell theory. This is one of the most important theories in life science. The cell theory can be summed up as follows: All organisms consist of one or more cells. Cells are alive and the site of all life processes. All cells come from pre-existing cells.  All cells have certain parts in common. These parts include the cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and ribosomes. The cell membrane is a thin coat of phospholipids that surrounds the cell. Its like the skin of the cell. It forms a physical boundary between the contents of the cell and the environment outside the cell. It also controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is sometimes called the plasma membrane. Cytoplasm is the material inside the cell membrane. It includes a watery substance called cytosol. Besides water, cytosol contains enzymes and other substances. Cytoplasm also includes other cell structures suspended in the cytosol. DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins. Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made. They consist of RNA and proteins. These four components are found in all cells. They are found in the cells of organisms as different as bacteria and people. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The answer is evolution. The similarities show that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor.  Besides the four parts listed above, many cells also have a nucleus. The nucleus of a cell is a structure enclosed by a membrane that contains most of the cells DNA. Cells are classified in two major groups based on whether or not they have a nucleus. The two groups are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.  Prokaryotic cells are cells that lack a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm, rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. All the organisms in the Bacteria and Archaea Domains have prokaryotic cells. No other organisms have this type of cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They are all single-celled organisms. They were the first type of organisms to evolve. They are still the most numerous organisms today. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 3.3. The cell in the figure is a bacterium. Notice how it contains a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and several other structures. However, the cell lacks a nucleus. The cells DNA is circular.",

        "context": "Vitamins and minerals are also nutrients. They do not provide energy, but they are needed for good health.  Vitamins are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. Humans need 13 different vitamins. Some of them are listed below ( Table 1.1). The table also shows how much of each vitamin you need every day. Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps maintain good vision. Vitamin B9 helps form red blood cells. Vitamin K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound. Vitamin Necessary for Available from Daily Amount Required (at ages 913 years) Vitamin Necessary for Available from A Good vision B1 Healthy nerves B3 Healthy skin and nerves B9 Red blood cells B12 Healthy nerves C Growth and repair of tis- sues Healthy bones and teeth Blood to clot Carrots, spinach, milk, eggs Whole wheat, peas, meat, beans, fish, peanuts Beets, liver, pork, turkey, fish, peanuts Liver, peas, dried beans, leafy green vegetables Meat, liver, milk, shell- fish, eggs Oranges, grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli Milk, salmon, tuna, eggs Spinach, brussels sprouts, milk, eggs D K Daily Amount Required (at ages 913 years) 600 g (1 g = 1  106 g) 0.9 mg (1 mg = 1  103 g) 12 mg 300 g 1.8 g 45 mg 5 g 60 g Some vitamins are produced in the body. For example, vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Vitamins B12 and K are produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other vitamins must come from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( Table 1.1). Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too little vitamin C causes a disease called scurvy. People with scurvy have bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms.  Minerals are chemical elements that are needed for body processes. Minerals that you need in relatively large amounts are listed below ( Table 1.2). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and zinc. Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are needed for strong bones and teeth. Potassium and sodium are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally.

Instead, you must get minerals from the foods you eat. Good sources of minerals include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( Table 1.2). Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too little calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which bones become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods.

Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. A chemical reaction can be represented by this general equation: Reactants ! Products The arrow (!) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. The reaction may occur quickly or slowly. For example, foam shoots out of a fire extinguisher as soon as the lever is pressed. But it might take years for metal to rust.  In chemical reactions, bonds break in the reactants and new bonds form in the products. The reactants and prod- ucts contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. Look at the example in Figure 8.2. It shows how water forms. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. Then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products, there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. But the atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at this URL: http://w  The arrow in Figure 8.2 shows that the reaction goes from left to right, from hydrogen and oxygen to water. The reaction can also go in the reverse direction. If an electric current passes through water, water molecules break down into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction would be represented by a right-to-left arrow ( ) in Figure Many other reactions can also go in both forward and reverse directions. Often, a point is reached at which the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall change in the amount of reactants and products. This point is called equilibrium, which refers to a balance between any opposing changes. You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at this URL:  Not all changes in matter involve chemical reactions. For example, there are no chemical reactions involved in changes of state. When liquid water freezes or evaporates, it is still water. No bonds are broken and no new products are formed. How can you tell whether a change in matter involves a chemical reaction? Often, there is evidence. Four common signs that a chemical reaction has occurred are: Change in color: the products are a different color than the reactants. Change in temperature: heat is released or absorbed during the reaction. Production of a gas: gas bubbles are released during the reaction. Production of a solid: a solid settles out of a liquid solution. The solid is called a precipitate.

        "context": "Assume that a school bus, like the one in Figure 12.2, passes by as you stand on the sidewalk. Its obvious to you that the bus is moving. It is moving relative to you and the trees across the street. But what about to the children inside the bus? They arent moving relative to each other. If they look only at the other children sitting near them, they will not appear to be moving. They may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by. This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. For the children on the bus, if they use other children riding the bus as their frame of reference, they do not appear to be moving. But if they use objects outside the bus as their frame of reference, they can tell they are moving. What is your frame of reference if you are standing on the sidewalk and see the bus go by? How can you tell the bus is moving? The video at the URL below illustrates other examples of how frame of reference is related to motion. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Did you ever go to a track meet like the one pictured in Figure 12.3? Running events in track include 100-meter sprints and 2000-meter races. Races are named for their distance. Distance is the length of the route between two points. The length of the route in a race is the distance between the starting and finishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, for example, the distance is 100 meters.  The SI unit for distance is the meter (1 m = 3.28 ft). Short distances may be measured in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m). Long distances may be measured in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m). For example, you might measure the distance a frogs tongue moves in centimeters and the distance a cheetah moves in kilometers.  Maps can often be used to measure distance. Look at the map in Figure 12.4. Find Mias house and the school. You can use the map key to directly measure the distance between these two points. The distance is 2 kilometers. Measure it yourself to see if you agree.  Things dont always move in straight lines like the route from Mias house to the school. Sometimes they change direction as they move. For example, the route from Mias house to the post office changes from west to north at the school (see Figure 12.4). To find the total distance of a route that changes direction, you must add up the distances traveled in each direction. From Mias house to the school, for example, the distance is 2 kilometers. From the school to the post office, the distance is 1 kilometer. Therefore, the total distance from Mias house to the post office is 3 kilometers. You Try It! Problem: What is the distance from the post office to the park in Figure 12.4? Direction is just as important as distance in describing motion. For example, if Mia told a friend how to reach the post office from her house, she couldnt just say, \"go 3 kilometers.\" The friend might end up at the park instead of the post office. Mia would have to be more specific. She could say, \"go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.\" When both distance and direction are considered, motion is a vector. A vector is a quantity that includes both size and direction. A vector is represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents distance. The way the arrow points shows direction.

        "context": "A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy from place to place. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. An example of a mechanical wave is pictured in Figure 19.1. A drop of water falls into a pond. This disturbs the water in the pond. What happens next? The disturbance travels outward from the drop in all directions. This is the wave. A source of energy is needed to start a mechanical wave. In this case, the energy comes from the falling drop of water.  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.  There are three types of mechanical waves. They differ in how they travel through a medium. The three types are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. All three types are described in detail below.  A transverse wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. An example of a transverse wave is a wave in a rope, like the one pictured in Figure 19.2. In this wave, energy is provided by a persons hand moving one end of the rope up and down. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the persons hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can see a brief video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:  . To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL:  (0:22). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A transverse wave can be characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. This is illustrated in Figure 19.3. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.  Another example of transverse waves occurs with earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called secondary, or S, waves. An S wave is illustrated in Figure 19.4.  A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates in the same direction that the wave travels. An example of a longitudinal wave is a wave in a spring, like the one in Figure 19.5. In this wave, the energy is provided by a persons hand pushing and pulling the spring. The coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the disturbance passes through them. The direction of the wave is down the length of the spring, or the same direction in which the coils move. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http  A longitudinal wave can be characterized by the compressions and rarefactions of the medium. This is illustrated in Figure 19.6. Compressions are the places where the coils are crowded together, and rarefactions are the places where the coils are spread apart.  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called primary, or P, waves. They are illustrated in Figure 19.7.  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. It combines a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. Ocean waves are surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean",

In the figure, salt and cellulose are examples of crystalline solids. The particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern. The steaks and candle wax are examples of amorphous (\"shapeless\") solids. Their particles have no definite pattern.  Ocean water is an example of a liquid. A liquid is matter that has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape. Instead, a liquid takes the shape of its container. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface will be exposed to the air, like the oil in the bottles in Figure 4.4. Two interesting properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like those in Figure 4.5. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flowing. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey in Figure 4.5 is more viscous than the vinegar.

URL:  Water vapor is an example of a gas. A gas is matter that has neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape. Instead, a gas takes both the volume and the shape of its container. It spreads out to take up all available space. You can see an example in Figure 4.6.  Youre probably less familiar with plasmas than with solids, liquids, and gases. Yet, most of the universe consists of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have. Like a gas, plasma lacks a fixed volume and shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetism. Thats because plasma contains charged particles called ions. This gives plasma other interesting properties. For example, it glows with light. Where can you find plasmas? Two examples are shown in Figure 4.7. The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasmas are also found naturally in lightning and the polar auroras (northern and southern lights). Artificial plasmas are found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma balls like the one that opened this chapter. You can learn more about plasmas at this URL:  (2:58). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Why do different states of matter have different properties? Its because of differences in energy at the level of atoms and molecules, the tiny particles that make up matter.  Energy is defined as the ability to cause changes in matter. You can change energy from one form to another when you lift your arm or take a step. In each case, energy is used to move matter  you. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy.  The particles that make up matter are also constantly moving. They have kinetic energy. The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter. You can learn more about it at the URL below.  Particles of matter of the same substance, such as the same element, are attracted to one another. The force of attraction tends to pull the particles closer together. The particles need a lot of kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction and move apart. Its like a tug of war between opposing forces. The kinetic energy of individual particles is on one side, and the force of attraction between different particles is on the other side. The outcome of the \"war\" depends on the state of matter. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8 and in the animation at this URL: http://w In solids, particles dont have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them.

        "context": "A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. It is a shorthand way of showing how atoms are rearranged in the reaction. The general form of a chemical equation was introduced in this chapters lesson \"Introduction to Chemical Reactions.\" It is: Reactants ! Products Consider the simple example in Figure 8.4. When carbon (C) reacts with oxygen (O2 ), it produces carbon dioxide (CO2 ). The chemical equation for this reaction is: C + O2 ! CO2 The reactants are one atom of carbon and one molecule of oxygen. When there is more than one reactant, they are separated by plus signs (+). The product is one molecule of carbon dioxide. If more than one product were produced, plus signs would be used between them as well.  Some chemical equations are more challenging to write. Consider the reaction in which hydrogen (H2 ) and oxygen (O2 ) combine to form water (H2 O). Hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants, and water is the product. To write a chemical equation for this reaction, you would start by writing symbols for the reactants and products: Equation 1: H2 + O2 ! H2 O Like equations in math, equations in chemistry must balance. There must be the same number of each type of atom in the products as there is in the reactants. In equation 1, count the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms on each side of the arrow. There are two hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products. There are two oxygen atoms in the reactants but only one in the product. Therefore, equation 1 is not balanced.  Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations. A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula. It shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction. For example, two molecules of hydrogen would be written as 2H2 . A coefficient of 1 usually isnt written. Coefficients can be used to balance equation 1 (above) as follows: Equation 2: 2H2 + O2 ! 2H2 O Equation 2 shows that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of water. The two molecules of hydrogen each contain two hydrogen atoms. There are now four hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products. Is equation 2 balanced? Count the oxygen atoms to find out.  Balancing a chemical equation involves a certain amount of trial and error. In general, however, you should follow these steps: 1. Count the number of each type of atom in reactants and products. Does the same number of each atom appear on both sides of the arrow? If not, the equation is not balanced, and you need to go to step 2. 2. Add coefficients to increase the number of atoms or molecules of reactants or products. Use the smallest coefficients possible. 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the equation is balanced. Helpful Hint When you balance chemical equations, never change the subscripts in chemical formulas. Changing subscripts changes the substances involved in the reaction. Change only the coefficients.

        "context": "Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Air quality, in turn, depends on many factors. Some natural processes add pollutants to the air. For example, forest fires and volcanoes add carbon dioxide and soot. In dry areas, the air often contains dust. However, human actions cause the most air pollution. The single biggest cause is fossil fuel burning.  Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. The machines in factories burned coal. This released a lot of pollutants into the air. After 1900, motor vehicles became common. Cars and trucks burn gasoline, which adds greatly to air pollution.  By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad. The worst incident came in December 1952. A temperature inversion over London, England, kept cold air and pollutants near the ground. The air became so polluted that thousands of people died in just a few days. This event was called the Big Smoke.  At the same time, many U.S. cities had air pollution problems. Some of the worst were in California. Cars were becoming more popular. Oil refineries and power plants also polluted the air. Mountain ranges trapped polluted air over cities. The California sunshine caused chemical reactions among the pollutants. These reactions produced many more harmful compounds.  By 1970, it was clear that something needed to be done to protect air quality. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be released into the air. As a result, the air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles, factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.  There are two basic types of pollutants in air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.  Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by human activities. They pour into the air from vehicles and smokestacks. Several of these pollutants are described below. Carbon oxides include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn. Nitrogen oxides include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ). Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants. Sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO3 ). Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal burns. Coal can contain up to 10 percent sulfur. Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury is used in some industrial processes. It is also found in fluorescent light bulbs. Lead was once widely used in gasoline, paint, and pipes. It is still found in some products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds such as methane. VOCs are released in many human activities, such as raising livestock. Livestock wastes produce a lot of methane. Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil fuels burn (see Figure 22.1).  Secondary pollutants form when primary pollutants undergo chemical reactions after they are released. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants react together in the presence of sunlight. You can see smog hanging in the air over San Francisco in Figure 22.2. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3 ). The ozone in smog is the same compound as the ozone in the ozone layer,(O3 ). But ozone in smog is found near the ground. Figure 22.3 shows how it forms. When nitrogen oxides and VOCs are heated by the Sun, they lose oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms combine with molecules of oxygen to form ozone. Smog ozone is harmful to humans and other living things.  Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released when forests burn.",

        "context": "Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from the nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. When they do, they gain or lose protons. Then the atoms become different elements. (Be careful not to confuse this radiation with electromagnetic radiation, which has to do with the light given off by atoms as they absorb and then emit energy.)  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel. Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which glows after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light and X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate. The plate was similar to film thats used today to take X-rays. You can see an example of an X-ray in Figure 11.1. As Becquerel predicted, the uranium left an image on the photographic plate. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day. He wasnt expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without being exposed to sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day. Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays without getting energy from light. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel prize. To learn more about the importance of Becquerels research, go to this URL: http://nobelprize.org/no Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term \"radioactivity.\" The other scientist was the French chemist Marie Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium. She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries. You can learn more about Marie Curie at this URL: http://nobelprize.or  Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ from each other because they have different numbers of neutrons. Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14. All carbon atoms have 6 protons, and most have 6 neutrons. These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the mass number (6 protons + 6 neutrons). A tiny percentage of carbon atoms have 8 neutrons instead of the usual 6. These atoms are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 are unstable because they have too many neutrons. To be stable, a small nucleus like carbon, with just 6 protons, must have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons. In other words, it must have the same number of neutrons as protons. In a large nucleus, with many protons, the ratio must be 2:1 or even 3:1 protons to neutrons. In elements with more than 83 protons, all the isotopes are radioactive (see Figure 11.2). The force of repulsion among all those protons overcomes the strong force holding them together. This makes the nuclei unstable and radioactive. Elements with more than 92 protons have such unstable nuclei that these elements do not even exist in nature. They exist only if they are created in a lab.  A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is called background radiation. It comes from various sources. One source is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. Another source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is generally considered to be safe for living things. A source of radiation that may be more dangerous is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks underground. It can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may build up and become harmful to people who breathe it.

        "context": "Assume that a school bus, like the one in Figure 12.2, passes by as you stand on the sidewalk. Its obvious to you that the bus is moving. It is moving relative to you and the trees across the street. But what about to the children inside the bus? They arent moving relative to each other. If they look only at the other children sitting near them, they will not appear to be moving. They may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by. This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference. Frame of reference refers to something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. For the children on the bus, if they use other children riding the bus as their frame of reference, they do not appear to be moving. But if they use objects outside the bus as their frame of reference, they can tell they are moving. What is your frame of reference if you are standing on the sidewalk and see the bus go by? How can you tell the bus is moving? The video at the URL below illustrates other examples of how frame of reference is related to motion. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Did you ever go to a track meet like the one pictured in Figure 12.3? Running events in track include 100-meter sprints and 2000-meter races. Races are named for their distance. Distance is the length of the route between two points. The length of the route in a race is the distance between the starting and finishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, for example, the distance is 100 meters.  The SI unit for distance is the meter (1 m = 3.28 ft). Short distances may be measured in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m). Long distances may be measured in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m). For example, you might measure the distance a frogs tongue moves in centimeters and the distance a cheetah moves in kilometers.  Maps can often be used to measure distance. Look at the map in Figure 12.4. Find Mias house and the school. You can use the map key to directly measure the distance between these two points. The distance is 2 kilometers. Measure it yourself to see if you agree.  Things dont always move in straight lines like the route from Mias house to the school. Sometimes they change direction as they move. For example, the route from Mias house to the post office changes from west to north at the school (see Figure 12.4). To find the total distance of a route that changes direction, you must add up the distances traveled in each direction. From Mias house to the school, for example, the distance is 2 kilometers. From the school to the post office, the distance is 1 kilometer. Therefore, the total distance from Mias house to the post office is 3 kilometers. You Try It! Problem: What is the distance from the post office to the park in Figure 12.4? Direction is just as important as distance in describing motion. For example, if Mia told a friend how to reach the post office from her house, she couldnt just say, \"go 3 kilometers.\" The friend might end up at the park instead of the post office. Mia would have to be more specific. She could say, \"go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.\" When both distance and direction are considered, motion is a vector. A vector is a quantity that includes both size and direction. A vector is represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents distance. The way the arrow points shows direction. The red arrows in Figure 12.4 are vectors for Mias route to the school and post office.

        "context": "A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy from place to place. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. An example of a mechanical wave is pictured in Figure 19.1. A drop of water falls into a pond. This disturbs the water in the pond. What happens next? The disturbance travels outward from the drop in all directions. This is the wave. A source of energy is needed to start a mechanical wave. In this case, the energy comes from the falling drop of water.  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.  There are three types of mechanical waves. They differ in how they travel through a medium. The three types are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. All three types are described in detail below.  A transverse wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. An example of a transverse wave is a wave in a rope, like the one pictured in Figure 19.2. In this wave, energy is provided by a persons hand moving one end of the rope up and down. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the persons hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can see a brief video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:  . To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL:  (0:22). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A transverse wave can be characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. This is illustrated in Figure 19.3. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.  Another example of transverse waves occurs with earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called secondary, or S, waves. An S wave is illustrated in Figure 19.4.  A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates in the same direction that the wave travels. An example of a longitudinal wave is a wave in a spring, like the one in Figure 19.5. In this wave, the energy is provided by a persons hand pushing and pulling the spring. The coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the disturbance passes through them. The direction of the wave is down the length of the spring, or the same direction in which the coils move. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http  A longitudinal wave can be characterized by the compressions and rarefactions of the medium. This is illustrated in Figure 19.6. Compressions are the places where the coils are crowded together, and rarefactions are the places where the coils are spread apart.  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called primary, or P, waves. They are illustrated in Figure 19.7.  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. It combines a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. Ocean waves are surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean",

        "context": "Elements form compounds when they combine chemically. Their atoms join together to form molecules, crystals, or other structures. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. It occurs when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom. You can learn more about chemical bonds in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Look at the example of water in Figure 7.1. A water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms share their two electrons with the six valence electrons of one oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. This gives it a more stable arrangement of electrons that takes less energy to maintain.  Water (H2 O) is an example of a chemical compound. Water molecules always consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Like water, all other chemical compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesnt matter how much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same composition.  Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Youve already seen the chemical formula for water. Its H2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used. Table 7.1 shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas.

What is its chemical formula? Solution: The chemical formula is NH3 . You Try It! Problem: A molecule of nitrogen dioxide consists of one atom of nitrogen (N) and two atoms of oxygen (O). What is its chemical formula?  The same elements may combine in different ratios. If they do, they form different compounds. Figure 7.2 shows some examples. Both water (H2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) consist of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If youve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Both carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How do their properties differ?  There are different types of compounds. They differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms together. The type of bonds in a compound determines many of its properties. Three types of bonds are ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.

In the figure, salt and cellulose are examples of crystalline solids. The particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern. The steaks and candle wax are examples of amorphous (\"shapeless\") solids. Their particles have no definite pattern.  Ocean water is an example of a liquid. A liquid is matter that has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape. Instead, a liquid takes the shape of its container. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface will be exposed to the air, like the oil in the bottles in Figure 4.4. Two interesting properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like those in Figure 4.5. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flowing. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey in Figure 4.5 is more viscous than the vinegar.

It spreads out to take up all available space. You can see an example in Figure 4.6.  Youre probably less familiar with plasmas than with solids, liquids, and gases. Yet, most of the universe consists of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain properties that a gas does not have. Like a gas, plasma lacks a fixed volume and shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetism. Thats because plasma contains charged particles called ions. This gives plasma other interesting properties. For example, it glows with light. Where can you find plasmas? Two examples are shown in Figure 4.7. The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasmas are also found naturally in lightning and the polar auroras (northern and southern lights). Artificial plasmas are found in fluorescent lights, plasma TV screens, and plasma balls like the one that opened this chapter. You can learn more about plasmas at this URL:  (2:58). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Why do different states of matter have different properties? Its because of differences in energy at the level of atoms and molecules, the tiny particles that make up matter.  Energy is defined as the ability to cause changes in matter. You can change energy from one form to another when you lift your arm or take a step. In each case, energy is used to move matter  you. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy.  The particles that make up matter are also constantly moving. They have kinetic energy. The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving particles is called the kinetic theory of matter. You can learn more about it at the URL below.  Particles of matter of the same substance, such as the same element, are attracted to one another. The force of attraction tends to pull the particles closer together. The particles need a lot of kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction and move apart. Its like a tug of war between opposing forces. The kinetic energy of individual particles is on one side, and the force of attraction between different particles is on the other side. The outcome of the \"war\" depends on the state of matter. This is illustrated in Figure 4.8 and in the animation at this URL: http://w In solids, particles dont have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. The particles are packed closely together and cannot move around. All they can do",

        "context": "As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious diseases of the reproductive system can be very serious. But there are ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep your reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as you can be, you should: Eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in fat. Drink plenty of water. Get regular exercise. Maintain a healthy weight. Get enough sleep. Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. Manage stress in healthy ways. Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or bath is all that it takes. Females do not need to use special feminine hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures. You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not get into contact with another persons blood or other body fluids. For example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the needles have not been used before. This is one of the most important ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity. If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play contact sports. Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey. Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. Signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the function of several body organs. Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, its a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young.

        "context": "Most of the time, you breathe without thinking about it. Breathing is mostly an involuntary action that is controlled by a part of your brain that also controls your heart beat. If you swim, do yoga, or sing, you know you can control your breathing, however. Taking air into the body through the nose and mouth is called inhalation. Pushing air out of the body through the nose or mouth is called exhalation. The woman pictured below is exhaling before she surfaces from the pool water (Figure 1.1). How do lungs allow air in? Air moves into and out of the lungs by the movement of muscles. The most important muscle in the process of breathing is the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle that spreads across the bottom of the rib cage. The diaphragm and rib muscles contract and relax to move air into and out of the lungs. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward. The rib muscles contract and cause the ribs to move outward. This causes the chest volume to increase. Because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. This difference in air pressures causes air to be sucked into the lungs. When the diaphragm and rib muscles relax, air is pushed out of the lungs. Exhalation is similar to letting the air out of a balloon. How does the inhaled oxygen get into the bloodstream? The exchange of gasses between the lungs and the blood happens in tiny sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin and allow gases to pass though them. The alveoli are lined with capillaries (Figure 1.2). Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves in the opposite direction, from capillary blood to the alveoli. The gases move by simple diffusion, passing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. For example, initially there is more oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood, so oxygen moves by diffusion from the alveoli into the blood.  The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide is called respiration. Sometimes breathing is called respiration, but there is much more to respiration than just breathing. Breathing is only the movement of oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the body. The process of respiration also includes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the cells of the body.",

        "context": "Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements. To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.  An element is defined by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of a given element contain the same number of protons. The number of neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown in Figure 11.15. Compare their protons and neutrons. Both contain 6 protons. But carbon-12 has 6 neutrons and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. Carbon-14 is unstable. Figure 11.16 shows carbon dioxide, which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Neutrons in cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. The nitrogen forms carbon- 14. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains.  Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an alpha particle. It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14. This is illustrated in Figure 11.17. The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate. This rate is different for each isotope pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years. Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5730 years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14. Over the next 5730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14. How many grams will there be in another 5730 years? Figure 11.18 graphs the rate of decay of carbon-14.  The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of dating is called radiometric dating.  The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating. A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in its body continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on. We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died. Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon- 14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old. Thats a blink of an eye in geologic time. But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites. Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes.  The isotopes in Table 11.1 are used to date igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives than carbon- 14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens. Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago?

        "context": "Love Canal gained worldwide attention in the late 1970s when the press started covering its story. The story is outlined below and illustrated in Figure 19.9.  The Love Canal disaster actually began back in the mid 1900s. The disaster continues even today. Starting in the early 1940s, a big chemical company put thousands of barrels of chemical waste into an old canal. Over the next 10 years, the company dumped almost 22,000 tons of chemicals into the ground! In the early 1950s, the company covered over the barrels in the canal with soil. Then they sold the land to the city for just a dollar. The city needed the land in order to build an elementary school. The company warned the city that toxic waste was buried there. But they thought the waste was safe. The school and hundreds of homes were also built over the old canal. As it turned out, the cheap price was no bargain. Chemicals started leaking from the barrels. Chemicals seeped into basements. Chemicals bubbled up to the surface of the ground. In some places, plants wouldnt even grow on the soil. People noticed bad smells. Many got sick, especially the children. Residents wanted to know if the old chemicals were the cause. But they had a hard time getting officials to listen. So they demonstrated and demanded answers. Finally, the soil was tested and was found to be contaminated with harmful chemicals. For example, it contained a lot of lead and mercury. Both can cause permanent damage to the human nervous system. The school was closed. More than 200 homes were evacuated. Much of the Love Canal neighborhood was bulldozed away. The area had a massive clean-up effort. The cleanup cost millions of dollars. More than three decades later, much of Love Canal is still too contaminated to be safe for people.  Love Canal opened peoples eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized there must be other Love Canals all over the country. Thousands of contaminated sites were found. The Superfund Act was passed in 1980. The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites, like the Elizabeth Copper Mine in Vermont (see the far-right image in Figure 19.9). The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the future.  Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is any waste that is dangerous to the health of people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic, corrosive, flammable, or explosive. Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth defects in people. It may also harm other living things. Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive waste may cause burns or destroy other materials that it touches. Flammable waste can burn easily. It may also give off harmful fumes when it burns. Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be greater if the waste is mixed with other substances. Table 19.1 shows some examples of hazardous waste. Look closely. Are any of these examples lurking around your home? Example Description Cars contain toxic fluids such as brake fluid. The fluids may also be corrosive and flammable. This photo shows one way the fluids can end up in the ground. Cars use gas and oil. These materials are toxic and flammable. They pollute the land when they leak or spill. Batteries contain toxic and corrosive materials. People often toss them in the trash, but they should be disposed of properly. Electronics, such as old computers, contain toxic chem- icals. They may be sent to landfills where the toxic materials end up in the ground. Medical waste can contain many hazards: Human body fluids may cause disease; old thermometers may contain toxic mercury; and pharmaceuticals may be toxic to people and other living things. Example Description Paints can be both toxic and flammable. Paints may spill on the ground or be thrown improperly in the trash. Chemicals are applied to farm fields and lawns. They include fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of these chemicals are toxic to people and other animals.  The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry. Agriculture is another major",

        "context": "A biochemical compound is any carbon-based compound found in living things. Like hydrocarbons, all biochemi- cal compounds contain hydrogen as well as carbon. However, biochemical compounds also contain other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers. They consist of many, smaller monomer molecules. Biochemical polymers are referred to as macromolecules. The prefix macro means \"large,\" and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may contain thousands of monomer molecules. Biochemical compounds make up the cells and tissues of organisms. They are also involved in life processes, such as making and using food for energy. Given their diversity of functions, its not surprising that there are millions of different biochemical compounds. However, they can be grouped into just four main classes: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The classes are summarized in Table 9.3 and described in the rest of this lesson.

They contain oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Organisms use carbohydrates mainly for energy.  Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugar have just a few carbon atoms. The simplest sugar is glucose (C6 H12 O6 ). Glucose is the sugar that the cells of living things use for energy. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by consuming plants or these other organisms. You can see the structural formula of glucose and two other sugars in Figure 9.16. The other sugars in the figure are fructose and sucrose. Fructose is an isomer of glucose. It is found in fruits. It has the same atoms as glucose, but they are arranged differently. Sucrose is table sugar. It consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose.  Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. They consist of hundreds of glucose monomers bonded together. Plants make starch to store extra sugars. Consumers get starch from plants. Common sources of starch in the human diet are pictured in Figure 9.17. Our digestive system breaks down starch to simple sugars, which our cells use for energy.  Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose. However, the glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form long, tough fibers (see Figure 9.18). Have you ever eaten raw celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain long, stringy fibers. The fibers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants and gives support to trunks and stems. Cellulose also provides needed fiber in the human diet. We cant digest cellulose, but it helps keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract.  Proteins are biochemical compounds that contain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur in addition to carbon and hydrogen. Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids.  Amino acids are the \"building blocks\" of proteins. There are 20 different common amino acids. The structural formula of the simplest amino acid, called glycine, is shown in Figure 9.19. Other amino acids have a similar structure. The sequence of amino acids and the number of amino acid chains in a protein determine the proteins shape. The shape of a protein, in turn, determines its function. Shapes may be very complex.

        "context": "A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.  Ores have high concentrations of valuable minerals. Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. To find an ore deposit, geologists will go to a likely spot. They then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks. Ore deposits contain valuable minerals. They may also contain other chemical elements that indicate an ore deposit is nearby. After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They outline the deposit and the surrounding geology on a map. The miners calculate the amount of valuable minerals they think they will get from the deposit. The minerals will only be mined if it is profitable. If it is profitable, they must then decide on the way it should be mined. The two main methods of mining are surface mining and underground mining. Placers are a type of surface deposit.  Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.  Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction.  If an ore is deep below Earths surface it may be too expensive to remove all the rock above it. These deposits are taken by underground mining. Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 m deep (that is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining. Tunnels must be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fresh air and lights must be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. The miners breathe in lots of particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the surrounding rock and taken out of the tunnels. Sometimes there are explosions as ore is being drilled or blasted. This can lead to a mine collapse. Miners may be hurt or killed in a mining accident.  Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans,",

        "context": "Ponds are small bodies of fresh water that usually have no outlet; ponds are often are fed by underground springs. Like lakes, ponds are bordered by hills or low rises so the water is blocked from flowing directly downhill.  Lakes are larger bodies of water. Lakes are usually fresh water, although the Great Salt Lake in Utah is just one exception. Water usually drains out of a lake through a river or a stream and all lakes lose water to evaporation. Lakes form in a variety of different ways: in depressions carved by glaciers, in calderas (Figure 1.1), and along tectonic faults, to name a few. Subglacial lakes are even found below a frozen ice cap. As a result of geologic history and the arrangement of land masses, most lakes are in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, more than 60% of all the worlds lakes are in Canada  most of these lakes were formed by the glaciers that covered most of Canada in the last Ice Age (Figure 1.2). Lakes are not permanent features of a landscape. Some come and go with the seasons, as water levels rise and fall. Over a longer time, lakes disappear when they fill with sediments, if the springs or streams that fill them diminish, (a) Crater Lake in Oregon is in a volcanic caldera. Lakes can also form in volcanic craters and impact craters. (b) The Great Lakes fill depressions eroded as glaciers scraped rock out from the landscape. (c) Lake Baikal, ice coated in winter in this image, formed as water filled up a tectonic faults. Lakes near Yellowknife were carved by glaciers during the last Ice Age. or if their outlets grow because of erosion. When the climate of an area changes, lakes can either expand or shrink (Figure 1.3). Lakes may disappear if precipitation significantly diminishes. Large lakes have tidal systems and currents, and can even affect weather patterns. The Great Lakes in the United States contain 22% of the worlds fresh surface water (Figure 1.1). The largest them, Lake Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day. The Great Lakes are large enough to alter the weather system in Northeastern United States by the lake effect, which is an increase in snow downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes are home to countless species of fish and wildlife. Many lakes are not natural, but are human-made. People dam a stream in a suitable spot and then let the water back up behind it, creating a lake. These lakes are called \"reservoirs.\" Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:",

        "context": "Problems can occur with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and other parts of the blood. Many blood disorders are genetic, meaning they are inherited from a parent. Some blood diseases are caused by not getting enough of a certain nutrient, while others are cancers of the blood.  Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells. Hemoglobin is the blood protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia leads to a lack of oxygen in organs. Anemia is usually caused by one of the following: A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood. The destruction of red blood cells. A lack of red blood cell production. Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise. They also may have poor concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times of activity. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron. Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly. In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men. The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation. Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in ones diet. Anemia is often treated or prevented by taking iron supplements. Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table 1.1). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Food Canned clams, drained, 3 oz. Fortified dry cereals, about 1 oz. Roasted pumpkin and squash seeds, 1 oz. Cooked lentils, 12 cup Cooked fresh spinach, 21 cup Cooked ground beef, 3 oz. Cooked sirloin beef, 3 oz. Milligrams (mg) of Iron 23.8 1.8 to 21.1 4.2 3.3 3.2 2.2 2.0  Sickle-cell anemia is a blood disease that is caused by an abnormally shaped hemoglobin protein in red blood cells. Many of the red blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia are long and curved (sickle-shaped) ( Figure 1.1). The long, sickle shape of the cells can cause them to get stuck in narrow blood vessels. This clotting means that oxygen cannot reach the cells. People with sickle-cell anemia are most often well but can occasionally have painful attacks. The disease is not curable, but it can be treated with medicines. The red blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia (left) are long and pointed, rather than straight, like normal cells (right). The abnormal cells cannot carry oxygen properly and can get stuck in capillaries.  Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells. Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow where blood is produced. In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood from performing many of its functions, like fighting off infections or preventing serious bleeding. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow. It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually white blood cells. Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called",

        "context": "Different rock types weather at different rates. Certain types of rock are very resistant to weathering. Igneous rocks, especially intrusive igneous rocks such as granite, weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Other types of rock, such as limestone, are easily weathered because they dissolve in weak acids. Rocks that resist weathering remain at the surface and form ridges or hills. Shiprock in New Mexico is the throat of a volcano thats left after the rest of the volcano eroded away. The rock thats left behind is magma that cooled relatively slowly and is harder than the rock that had surrounded it. Different minerals also weather at different rates. Some minerals in a rock might completely dissolve in water, but the more resistant minerals remain. In this case, the rocks surface becomes pitted and rough. When a less resistant mineral dissolves, more resistant mineral grains are released from the rock. A beautiful example of this effect is the \"Stone Forest\" in China, see the video below: The Shiprock formation in northwest New Mexico is the central plug of resistant lava from which the surrounding rock weath- ered and eroded away.

Climate is determined by the temperature of a region plus the amount of precipitation it receives. Climate is weather averaged over a long period of time. Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. For each 10o C increase in average temperature, the rate of chemical reactions doubles. Precipitation increases: More water allows more chemical reactions. Since water participates in both mechan- ical and chemical weathering, more water strongly increases weathering. So how do different climates influence weathering? A cold, dry climate will produce the lowest rate of weathering. A warm, wet climate will produce the highest rate of weathering. The warmer a climate is, the more types of vegetation it will have and the greater the rate of biological weathering (Figure 1.2). This happens because plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster in warmer temperatures.  Some resources are concentrated by weathering processes. In tropical climates, intense chemical weathering carries away all soluble minerals, leaving behind just the least soluble components. The aluminum oxide, bauxite, forms this way and is our main source of aluminum ore.",

        "context": "Carbon is an element. By itself, its a black solid. You can see a lump of carbon in Figure 18.10. Carbon is incredibly important because of what it makes when it combines with many other elements. Carbon can form a wide variety of substances. For example, in the air, carbon combines with oxygen to form the gas carbon dioxide. In living things, carbon combines with several other elements. For example, it may combine with nitrogen and  In the carbon cycle, carbon moves through living and nonliving things. Carbon actually moves through two cycles that overlap. One cycle is mainly biotic; the other cycle is mainly abiotic. Both cycles are shown in Figure 18.11.  Producers such as plants or algae use carbon dioxide in the air to make food. The organisms combine carbon dioxide with water to make sugar. They store the sugar as starch. Both sugar and starch are carbohydrates. Consumers get carbon when they eat producers or other consumers. Carbon doesnt stop there. Living things get energy from food in a process called respiration. This releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The cycle then repeats.  Carbon from decaying organisms enters the ground. Some carbon is stored in the soil. Some carbon may be stored underground for millions of years. This will form fossil fuels. When volcanoes erupt, carbon from the mantle is released as carbon dioxide into the air. Producers take in the carbon dioxide to make food. Then the cycle repeats. The oceans also play an important role in the carbon cycle. Ocean water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. In fact, the oceans contain 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. Much of the carbon sinks to the bottom of the oceans, where it may stay for hundreds of years.  Human actions are influencing the carbon cycle. Burning of fossil fuels releases the carbon dioxide that was stored in ancient plants. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and is a cause of global warming. Forests are also being destroyed. Trees may be cut down for their wood, or they may be burned to clear the land for farming. Burning wood releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. You can see how a tropical rainforest was cleared for farming in Figure 18.12. With forests shrinking, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the air. This makes the greenhouse effect even worse.  Living things also need nitrogen. Nitrogen is a key element in proteins. Like carbon, nitrogen cycles through ecosystems. You can see the nitrogen cycle in Figure 18.13.  Air is about 78 percent nitrogen. Decomposers release nitrogen into the air from dead organisms and their wastes. However, producers such as plants cant use these forms of nitrogen. Nitrogen must combine with other elements before producers can use it. This is done by certain bacteria in the soil. Its called fixing nitrogen.  Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients needed by plants. Thats why most plant fertilizers contain nitrogen. Adding fertilizer to soil allows more plants to grow. As a result, a given amount of land can produce more food. So far, so good. But what happens next? Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure 18.14 shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure 18.14.",

        "context": "While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets worked to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft. People can live on this craft for a long period of time.  Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit. Figure 23.22 shows the last of these, Salyut 7. These were all temporary stations. They were launched and later inhabited by a human crew. Three of the Salyut stations were used for secret military purposes. The others were used to study the problems of living in space. Cosmonauts aboard the stations performed a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports. One crew could dock a spacecraft to one end. A replacement crew could dock to the other end. The U.S. only launched one space station during this time. It was called Skylab. Skylab was launched in May 1973. Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects of staying in space for long period. Devices on board were and for studying the Sun. Skylab reentered Earths atmosphere in 1979, sooner than expected.  The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station (Figure 23.23). Mir was launched in several separate pieces. These pieces were put together in space. Mir holds the current record for the longest continued presence in space. There were people living on Mir continuously for almost 10 years! Mir was the first major space project in which the United States and Russia worked together. American space shuttles transported supplies and people to and from Mir. American astronauts lived on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the two nations to learn from each other. The U.S. learned about Russias experiences with long-duration space flights. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001. It fell into the Pacific Ocean.  The International Space Station, shown in Figure 23.24 is a joint project between the space agencies of many nations These include the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA), several European countries (ESA) and the Brazilian Space Agency. The International Space Station is a very large station. It has many different sections and is still being assembled. The station has had people on board since 2000. American space shuttles deliver most of the supplies and equipment to the station. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research. This is important because the station has a microgravity environment. Experiments are done in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology and medicine.  NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle. This vehicle had to be reusable. It had to able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The new vehicle was called a space shuttle, shown in Figure 23.25. There have been five space shuttles: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. A space shuttle has three main parts. You are probably most familiar with the orbiter. This part has wings like At the end of the mission, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. The outside heats up as it descends. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The orbiter is later hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane.  The space shuttle program has been very successful. Over 100 mission have been flown. Space shuttle missions have made many scientific discoveries. Crews have launched many satellites. There have been other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had two tragic disasters. The first came just 73 seconds after launch, on January 28, 1986. The space shuttle Challenger disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in Figure 23.27. On board were seven crew members. All of them died. One of them was Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space.",

        "context": "A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.  Ores have high concentrations of valuable minerals. Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. To find an ore deposit, geologists will go to a likely spot. They then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks. Ore deposits contain valuable minerals. They may also contain other chemical elements that indicate an ore deposit is nearby. After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They outline the deposit and the surrounding geology on a map. The miners calculate the amount of valuable minerals they think they will get from the deposit. The minerals will only be mined if it is profitable. If it is profitable, they must then decide on the way it should be mined. The two main methods of mining are surface mining and underground mining. Placers are a type of surface deposit.  Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.  Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction.  If an ore is deep below Earths surface it may be too expensive to remove all the rock above it. These deposits are taken by underground mining. Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 m deep (that is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining. Tunnels must be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fresh air and lights must be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. The miners breathe in lots of particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the surrounding rock and taken out of the tunnels. Sometimes there are explosions as ore is being drilled or blasted. This can lead to a mine collapse. Miners may be hurt or killed in a mining accident.  Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans,",

All of these energy resources are nonrenewable. Nonrenewable resources are resources that are limited in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. Renewable resources, in contrast, provide only 8 percent of all energy used in the U.S. Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply.

        "context": "A mechanical wave is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy from place to place. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. An example of a mechanical wave is pictured in Figure 19.1. A drop of water falls into a pond. This disturbs the water in the pond. What happens next? The disturbance travels outward from the drop in all directions. This is the wave. A source of energy is needed to start a mechanical wave. In this case, the energy comes from the falling drop of water.  The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. This matter is called the medium (plural, media). The medium in Figure 19.1 is a liquid the water in the pond. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of matter, including a solid or a gas. Its important to note that particles of matter in the medium dont actually travel along with the wave. Only the energy travels. The particles of the medium just vibrate, or move back-and- forth or up-and-down in one spot, always returning to their original positions. As the particles vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.  There are three types of mechanical waves. They differ in how they travel through a medium. The three types are transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves. All three types are described in detail below.  A transverse wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates at right angles to the direction that the wave travels. An example of a transverse wave is a wave in a rope, like the one pictured in Figure 19.2. In this wave, energy is provided by a persons hand moving one end of the rope up and down. The direction of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the persons hand. The rope itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can see a brief video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:  . To see a transverse wave in slow motion, go to this URL:  (0:22). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A transverse wave can be characterized by the high and low points reached by particles of the medium as the wave passes through. This is illustrated in Figure 19.3. The high points are called crests, and the low points are called troughs.  Another example of transverse waves occurs with earthquakes. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends transverse waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called secondary, or S, waves. An S wave is illustrated in Figure 19.4.  A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the medium vibrates in the same direction that the wave travels. An example of a longitudinal wave is a wave in a spring, like the one in Figure 19.5. In this wave, the energy is provided by a persons hand pushing and pulling the spring. The coils of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart as the disturbance passes through them. The direction of the wave is down the length of the spring, or the same direction in which the coils move. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at this URL: http  A longitudinal wave can be characterized by the compressions and rarefactions of the medium. This is illustrated in Figure 19.6. Compressions are the places where the coils are crowded together, and rarefactions are the places where the coils are spread apart.  Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves. The disturbance that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground rocks in all directions from the disturbance. Earthquake waves that travel this way are called primary, or P, waves. They are illustrated in Figure 19.7.  A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium. It combines a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. Ocean waves are surface waves. They travel on the surface of the water between the ocean",

        "context": "Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements. To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.  An element is defined by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of a given element contain the same number of protons. The number of neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown in Figure 11.15. Compare their protons and neutrons. Both contain 6 protons. But carbon-12 has 6 neutrons and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. Carbon-14 is unstable. Figure 11.16 shows carbon dioxide, which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Neutrons in cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. The nitrogen forms carbon- 14. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains.  Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an alpha particle. It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14. This is illustrated in Figure 11.17. The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate. This rate is different for each isotope pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years. Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5730 years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14. Over the next 5730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14. How many grams will there be in another 5730 years? Figure 11.18 graphs the rate of decay of carbon-14.  The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of dating is called radiometric dating.  The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating. A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in its body continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on. We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died. Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon- 14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old. Thats a blink of an eye in geologic time. But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites. Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes.  The isotopes in Table 11.1 are used to date igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives than carbon- 14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens. Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago?

        "context": "Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7. For a funny, fast-paced overview of fungi, watch this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants.  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.  The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land.  Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.  Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below.  During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.  Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents.",

        "context": "Both you and the speck of dust consist of atoms of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume.  Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead.  The more matter an object contains, generally the more it weighs. However, weight is not the same thing as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object. It is measured with a scale, like the kitchen- scale in Figure 3.2. The scale detects how forcefully objects in the pan are being pulled downward by the force of gravity. The SI unit for weight is the newton (N). The common English unit is the pound (lb). With Earths gravity, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N (2.2 lb). Problem Solving Problem: At Earths gravity, what is the weight in newtons of an object with a mass of 10 kg? Solution: At Earths gravity, 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N. Therefore, 10 kg has a weight of (10  9.8 N) = 98 N. You Try It! Problem: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force, so mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes, even while the mass of the object remains constant. Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, in Figure 3.3. An astronaut weighed less on the moon than he did on Earth because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An \"empty\" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an \"empty\" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l  w  h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used to measure volume. You can see how it works in Figure 3.4 and in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements.  Matter has many properties. Some are physical properties. Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance. For example, whether a given substance normally exists as a solid, liquid, or gas is a physical property. Consider water. It is a liquid at room temperature, but if it freezes and",

        "context": "Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Air quality, in turn, depends on many factors. Some natural processes add pollutants to the air. For example, forest fires and volcanoes add carbon dioxide and soot. In dry areas, the air often contains dust. However, human actions cause the most air pollution. The single biggest cause is fossil fuel burning.  Poor air quality started to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. The machines in factories burned coal. This released a lot of pollutants into the air. After 1900, motor vehicles became common. Cars and trucks burn gasoline, which adds greatly to air pollution.  By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad. The worst incident came in December 1952. A temperature inversion over London, England, kept cold air and pollutants near the ground. The air became so polluted that thousands of people died in just a few days. This event was called the Big Smoke.  At the same time, many U.S. cities had air pollution problems. Some of the worst were in California. Cars were becoming more popular. Oil refineries and power plants also polluted the air. Mountain ranges trapped polluted air over cities. The California sunshine caused chemical reactions among the pollutants. These reactions produced many more harmful compounds.  By 1970, it was clear that something needed to be done to protect air quality. In the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be released into the air. As a result, the air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles, factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.  There are two basic types of pollutants in air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.  Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by human activities. They pour into the air from vehicles and smokestacks. Several of these pollutants are described below. Carbon oxides include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn. Nitrogen oxides include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ). Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants. Sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO3 ). Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal burns. Coal can contain up to 10 percent sulfur. Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury is used in some industrial processes. It is also found in fluorescent light bulbs. Lead was once widely used in gasoline, paint, and pipes. It is still found in some products. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds such as methane. VOCs are released in many human activities, such as raising livestock. Livestock wastes produce a lot of methane. Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil fuels burn (see Figure 22.1).  Secondary pollutants form when primary pollutants undergo chemical reactions after they are released. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants react together in the presence of sunlight. You can see smog hanging in the air over San Francisco in Figure 22.2. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3 ). The ozone in smog is the same compound as the ozone in the ozone layer,(O3 ). But ozone in smog is found near the ground. Figure 22.3 shows how it forms. When nitrogen oxides and VOCs are heated by the Sun, they lose oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms combine with molecules of oxygen to form ozone. Smog ozone is harmful to humans and other living things.  Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released when forests burn.",
